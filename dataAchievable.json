If the common stock price rises, the investor can convert and sell the common shares at a gain.</p><p>Bonds are generally viewed as safe investments (especially compared to common stock), so a portfolio made 100% of bonds would not typically be considered aggressive.

Let's perform the calculation above using this variable:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Time needed to 2x money = 72 / 6%</b></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Time needed to 2x money = 12 years</b></p><p><em>When using this calculation, do not enter the rate of return on a typical decimal basis.

Their time horizon is 24 years, exactly twice the amount of time they need to double their money. Therefore, they need to invest enough funds today for their money to double <b>twice</b> over the 24 year period.</p><p>The best way to calculate this is to divide the ending value goal ($500,000) by 4.

In particular, the client believes they can achieve an average annual return of 6% from now until they turn age 68 (when they plan on investing these funds into the immediate annuity).

When the investor is young, a smaller portion of the premiums pay for the death benefit. The rest of the premium goes to cash value, which is placed in the investor's separate account. The cash value is invested by the policyholder in the separate account, which subjects them to investment risks (e.g. market risk). There is no guarantee of growth, which is dependent on investment performance. Separate accounts may be invested in the stock market, which tends to outpace inflation levels and reduce (mitigate) any related risks.</p><p>The client's needs are met by matching them with this form of life insurance. Variable life insurance provides coverage for life, has fixed premium payments, and the cash value can outpace inflation if the policyholder invests in the stock market. Cash value can be borrowed or withdrawn. Any borrowed amount that goes unreturned or any amount that is withdrawn permanently typically reduces the death benefit.</p><p>Term life insurance does not provide coverage for life, while neither universal or whole life insurance have a separate account (making both subject to increased inflation risk).
