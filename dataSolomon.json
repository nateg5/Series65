        "question": "Kevin owns $500,000 in Treasury bonds, and wishes to use Treasury bond futures contracts to fully hedge his position.  Assuming a contract size of $100,000, how should Kevin hedge his position?",
        "explanation": "Since Kevin owns Treasury bonds, he will gain on his bond holding when Treasury prices increase, and lose on his bond holding when Treasury prices decrease.  To hedge his bond holdings with futures, the futures position must move in the opposite direction:  lose when Treasury prices increase, and gain when Treasury prices decrease.  A short position on the Treasury futures will exhibit this gain/loss profile.  Since the contract size is given as $100,000, and Kevin wants to fully hedge his $500,000 of bond holdings, he needs to go short enough contracts to get $500,000 of futures exposure:  $500,000 exposure desired/$100,000 per contract = 5 contracts.  Kevin needs to short 5 contracts to fully hedge.",

        "question": "Trapezoid Investments is an investment adviser that manages client portfolios.  Trapezoid Investments is considering charging several clients a fee based on its portfolio performance vs. the performance of the S&P 500.  For which of the following clients is such an arrangement allowable?  <br />I. Maria, a client with $100,000 in assets to invest with Trapezoid  <br />II. Cory, who has $2,000,000 of assets to invest with Trapezoid   <br />III. A mutual fund",
        "explanation": "In general, advisers managing an investment portfolio should be compensated as a percentage of assets under management over a specified time period.  However, an adviser is allowed to charge certain \"sophisticated\" investors an advisory fee based on portfolio performance vs. an index.  Among these investors are people or businesses with over $1,000,000 in assets under management, and registered investment companies, such as mutual funds.  So Trapezoid may charge a fee based on performance vs. the S&P 500 to Cory (Item II), since Cory has over $1,000,000 to invest, and to the mutual fund (Item III).  Maria (Item I), with only $100,000 to invest, does not meet the criteria for a sophisticated investor, so Trapezoid cannot structure her fees to be based on performance vs. the S&P 500.",

Company XYZ must file an 8-K within 60 to 90 days of December 31",
        "explanation": "The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows the SEC to require corporations to file financial information on a regular basis.  The SEC currently requires an annual report, known as a 10-K, to be filed within 60 to 90 days of the end of each company's fiscal year.  The SEC also requires quarterly reports, known as 10-Q's, to be filed within 40 to 45 days of the end of each fiscal quarter (three-month period).  Since XYZ has a December 31 fiscal year-end, it must file a 10-K within 60 to 90 days of December 31.  Statement II is therefore true.  XYZ is also required to file 10-Q's within 40 to 45 days of its quarter-end dates of March 31, June 30, and September 30.  Statement I is therefore also true. The SEC does not have a requirement known as the “3-Q“, so Statement III is not true (as noted above, a 10-Q is due for within 40 to 45 days of September 30). The 8-K is for reporting special events, rather than being part of a company's annual and quarterly reporting, so Statement IV is not true.",

Such a strategy is less in line with EMT than a passive strategy (Item II), which typically just involves buying an index and not actively buying and selling stocks.  Similarly, a tactical asset allocation strategy (Item III) involves trying to time the market to seek outperformance, and is less in line with the EMT than a strategic investment strategy (Item IV), which involves picking a long term asset allocation and sticking to it.

        "question": "Given the following assumptions for stock ABC, what is its expected return using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?  <br>Risk Free Rate: 1%, <br>Expected Return on general stock market: 7%, <br>Beta: 1.5, <br>Sharpe Ratio: 2.",
        "explanation": "The formula for the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is given by  the following:  Return on Stock = Risk Free Rate + Beta of Stock x (Return on Market - Risk Free Rate).  Plugging in for Stock ABC gives Return on Stock ABC = 1% + [1.5 x (7% - 1%) = 10%].  Note the Sharpe Ratio is not used in the CAPM formula.\n",
