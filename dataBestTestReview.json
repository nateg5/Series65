		"explanation": "Limited liability is satisfied by the LLC and the C Corp. A Limited Partnership would not fit the bill, because it has to have a General Partner who assumes full general liability for the debts of the business, which is not what your client wants. A General Partnership is unacceptable for the same reason. The LLC has flow through tax benefits because it is not a taxable entity, whereas a C Corporation is a taxable business entity.",

Since zeroes pay no semi-annual interest, one has to wait until the maturity date to get back the original investment.

The GTC stop order placed above the market (buy stop order) will be triggered if the stock rises high enough to touch the stop price. But there is no guaranteed execution price with a stop order, therefore the client's attempt to limit loss might be compromised with a stop order. However, buying a call option guarantees the client the right to buy 100 shares of the subject stock at a guaranteed exercise or strike price, making it the most effective of the hedges.
