Those who purchase put options have the same market view as those who sell short-they will profit if the price of the security declines. Buying a put would be the equivalent of \"doubling down\" on your bet. The best way to hedge (protect) a short stock position is to purchase a call option on the security because that gives you a guaranteed \"buy-back\" price regardless of how high the stock's price rises. If you sell a put on the stock and the price rises, the put will expire and the seller will have the premium to partially offset any loss. If the short seller enters a buy stop order, once the price rises (or goes through) the stop price, a market order to buy the stock will be entered and the position will be closed out preventing any further loss.",
