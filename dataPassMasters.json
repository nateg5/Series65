        "explanation": "<p>The advance/decline ratio is often used to highlight the market's breadth. The formula takes the stocks advancing divided by stocks declining. It can be calculated for different time periods, daily, weekly, monthly. This ratio allows technical analysts to understand if an increase or decrease in a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, is driven by just a few stocks or by a large number of securities. If this ratio increases over time it is generally thought to be a bullish indicator, and vice versa, if it declines over time it is thought to be a bearish indicator. A high ratio can signal an overbought market, one that is ready for a near term decline as investors sell stock to lock in their profits. A low ratio can signal an oversold market, one that is ready for a near term increase in prices as investors buy at support.<br></p>",

        "explanation": "<p><span>Anytime a security has a fixed payment, whether or not it is interest income or dividend income, that security has interest rate risk. Bonds have interest rate risk. As interest rates go up, the prices of bonds in the secondary market will go down. If interest rates go down, the prices of bonds in the secondary market will go up. The same holds for preferred stock. Remember, preferred stock has a fixed dividend rate. This does not guarantee that a dividend will be paid, but if a dividend is paid how much it will be is fixed. Preferred stocks' market price is inversely related to interest rate changes. Bank CDs pay a fixed interest rate, that is reflective of interest rates in the economy when the money was invested, but that does not change over the life of the CD. Bank CDs do not have interest rate risk. Bank CDs have liquidity risk and reinvestment risk!</span></p>",

For her QCD to count towards her current year's RMD, the funds must come out of her IRA by this year's RMD deadline of December 31st. The distribution must be made payable to the 501(c)(3) organization, not to Tiler. Any QCD Tiler makes this year counts towards her RMD.
