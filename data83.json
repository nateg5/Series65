Overbought generally refers to the resistance level. Interest in buying the stock has begun to dry up and the price of the stock plateaus. Oversold is when the opposite occurs: there are few sellers to be found and the price of the stock bottoms. In either case, the next move is a reversal: down when the stock is overbought and up when oversold.<br /><br />U12LO6</span>"
