If a teacher (or any of the others) is compensated specifically for giving advice, even if it's a small amount, the exclusion is no longer valid. To be classified as an investment adviser, one must provide advice on securities; term life insurance does not qualify as a security. Additionally, preparing trust documents does not constitute securities advice, even if clients are referred by an investment adviser. Lastly, accountants often provide tax advice, and IRAs are not considered securities.<br /><br />U1LO3</span>"
