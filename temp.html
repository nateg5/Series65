1. A. Insider trading is covered primarily in
the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud
Enforcement Act of 1988, as well as the
10(b) sections of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Of course, it is the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 that deals with
securities exchanges. A deficiency letter
is used by the SEC to extend the 20-day
cooling-off period when something is
missing from the registration statement.
2. D. Intrastate issues are exempt from the
Securities Act of 1933 under Rule 147. U.S.
government securities are always exempt.
Regulation D is the private placement
exemption.
3. A. This is the definition of churning.
4. C. An offer can only be made with an effective
prospectus. A red herring is neither an offer
to sell nor an offer of a solicitation to buy;
it may only be used to obtain indications of
interest.
5. B. Every prospectus carries the SEC disclaimer
on the front cover in bold type. All the
SEC can hope for is full disclosure of the
pertinent information.
6. C. These securities are eligible for the
intrastate exemption afforded under Rule
147. They might have to register in that
particular state, depending on whether
they met the exemption requirements in
that state for that type of issue. Only under
the NSMIA and the Uniform Securities
Act do securities listed on a national stock
exchange receive a registration exemption,
as will be covered in the next session.
7. D. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
requires registration of securities exchanges,
as well as the securities listed on those
exchanges. It also requires registration of
corporations whose securities are listed. All
broker-dealers (other than intrastate) must
register, as well as SROs, such as FINRA
and the MSRB.
8. B. Choice A relates to the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939 (not tested); Choice C relates
to SIPA of 1970, which created SIPC (also
not tested); and Choice D relates to the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
9. C. An individual who is convicted of, or
has pleaded guilty or no contest to, any
felony or certain misdemeanors in the
previous 10 years (120 months) is subject
to statutory disqualification. A conviction
made more than 10 years ago is part of the
record but not cause for disqualification. A
misdemeanor involving a financial matter
within the past 10 years is a cause for
disqualification. Accusation is not the same
as conviction.
10. B. Under the Securities Act of 1933, there are
two requirements for commercial paper to
be exempt from registration: maturity may
not exceed nine months and proceeds must
be used for current operational needs.
 Acquiring machinery would not be considered current because the result is new
fixed assets. Rating and denominations
are only important under the Uniform
Securities Act.
11. B. The term any person does not include the
designated agent of an investment club.
Groups put together for the purpose of
investing together, such as an investment
club or clients of an investment adviser, do
not qualify. Although there are exceptions,
the exam will deal with accounts for minor
children only.
ANSWERS AND RATIONALES

262 Series 65 Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam, 10th Edition
12. A. An investment company may own up to
3% of another investment company. Even
though FINRA rules do require approval of
investment company communications with
the public, such approval is not part of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.
13. A. Section 30(d) of the act requires
semiannual reports from the fund.
Although filing is required with the
SEC, the company does not file with its
shareholders. In the description of the
types of investment companies, holding
companies (which invest in other
companies for the purpose of management
control) are not included.
14. D. The SEC does not approve securities.
15. B. Securities information processors (SIPs) are
regulated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. They include any person
engaged in the business of collecting,
processing, or preparing for distribution
or publication information dealing with
transactions in, or quotations for, any
nonexempt security; or distributing or
publishing (whether by means of a ticker
tape, a communications network, a
terminal display device, or otherwise), on a
current and continuing basis, information
with respect to such transactions or
quotations.
16. C. A prospectus deals with new issues, so
the term is defined in the Securities Act
of 1933.

1. A. Remember all stockholders (even preferred
stockholders) are owners of a corporation,
not creditors.
2. B. Preferred stock carries a fixed dividend that
must be paid before any distribution to
common stockholders—hence the name
preferred. However, unlike the interest on
a debt security, there is no obligation to
pay the dividend. Therefore, the yield on
a company’s preferred stock is invariably
higher than that on its debt issues.
Disadvantages of owning preferred stock
are that the fixed return may not keep up
with inflation and, regardless of corporate
earnings, the dividend will not change, so
there is no hope for increased income.
3. C. Debt securities, because they are an
obligation of the issuer, are generally
considered safer than equity securities. The
only one of these debt obligations with
pledged assets as security for the loan is the
mortgage bond.
4. A. There are no pledged assets behind a
debenture, merely the credit standing of the
corporation. It is a corporate IOU.
5. D. Treasury bills are always issued at a
discount, they pay no interest. The
investor profits by receiving back par
value and makes the difference between
the discounted purchase price and the par
received at maturity. All government bonds
are now book entry; there has not been
a Treasury note or bond issued since July
1986 with interest coupons attached.
6. D. Choice A would be correct if the question
referred to Moody’s.
7. C. Although municipal bonds are sometimes
exempt from state income tax (if issued in
the state of residence of the taxpayer), all
references to tax exemption refer to their
exemption from federal income taxes.
8. B. The current yield of any security, equity, or
debt is always the income return (dividend
or interest) divided by the current market
price. In this case, it is
5 5
110
5 . = %
9. A. Any bond selling at a premium will yield
less than the coupon rate (nominal yield).
Conversely, of course, a bond trading
at a discount will certainly yield more.
Remember, there is an inverse relationship
between bond prices and bond yields. See
the previous question for an example of a
bond selling at a premium.
10. A. A bond that is callable has a provision that
the issuer, at its option, may redeem that
bond at a specified price known as the call
or redemption price.

1. C. Industrial production is a coincident
indicator. The stock indexes and
manufacturing orders are leading indicators.
Economists do not use agricultural
employment as an indicator.
2. B. The CPI does not measure the increase or
decrease in the level of consumer prices
with respect to the level of wholesale
prices. The CPI only measures retail prices
whether or not wholesale prices are passed
through to the consumer.
3. C. Monetarists believe that the economy and
inflation are best controlled through the
management of the money supply rather
than through fiscal policy stimulation.
4. B. When the U.S. dollar loses value, compared
with a foreign currency, the same amount of
the foreign currency now buys more dollars.
As a result, U.S. goods are cheaper in terms
of that foreign currency, which means that
the foreign country tends to buy more U.S.
products and U.S. exports rise.
5. D. Foreign interest rate differentials are not
reflected in an upward sloping yield curve.
Interest rate differentials between countries
reflect differences in domestic monetary
and fiscal conditions. The time value of
money is reflected in the upward sloping
yield curve. Longer-term rates require
higher rates to compensate for loss of
current buying power and liquidity. Longerterm funds bear a higher risk of default
than do shorter-term funds and, as a result,
command higher rates. Increasing inflation
expectations cause the yield curve to slope
upward to compensate lenders for the loss
of future buying power.

1. C. John’s investment in the yacht-building
business suffered a loss as a result of
legislative risk. In other words, the rules of
the game (i.e., tax laws) changed after John
purchased the security.
2. C. This imposing-looking question should take
10 seconds to do. When the question is
dealing with volatility, look for the standard
deviation. The portfolio with the lowest
(choice C at 10.02) is the least volatile, the
one with the highest (choice A at 12.25) is
the most volatile.
3. C. The return from a security can be adjusted
for the risk associated with it by subtracting
the risk-free rate from the security’s actual
return and then dividing that by its
standard deviation, the basic measure of
unsystematic risk. This is commonly known
as the Sharpe ratio.
4. D. To determine the total return on this zerocoupon debt obligation, the $50 capital
appreciation is divided by the cost of the
bond, in this case $950, for a total return
of 5.26%. Total return of a zero-coupon
security is made up entirely of the difference
between the cost of the security and its sale
or maturity price. The market price of the
security, not current interest rates, is used in
the calculation of total return. Five percent
would be the return had the debt obligation
cost 100, or par. There is no coupon rate to
be added to the calculation.
5. B. Duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to
a change in interest rates. The longer the
duration, the greater the change in a bond’s
price with respect to interest rate changes.
6. C. The yield to maturity reflects the
annualized return of a bond if it is held
to its maturity. The computation reflects
internal rate of return and is frequently
referred to as the market required rate
of return for a debt security. The rate set
at issuance and printed on the face of
the bond is the nominal or coupon rate.
Dividing the coupon rate by the current
market price of the bond provides the
current yield. The return of a bond if it is
held to the call date is the yield to call.
7. B. In an efficient market, all participants have
equal access to information and, therefore,
stock prices reflect that equality almost
immediately.
8. C. The expected return is the estimate of
probable returns that an investment may
yield when added up.
9. A. First, compute Dan’s after-tax rate of
return of 10.95% as follows: .15 × (1 −
.27), or .73 = .1095. Then, compute Dan’s
inflation-adjusted, or real, rate of return by
subtracting the 3% inflation rate from his
10.95% after-tax return.
10. B. Because dollar-weighted returns reflect
the individual investor’s cash deposits and
withdrawals from the investment account,
it is the preferred measure of return for
them. On the other hand, time-weighted
returns are generally a more important tool
to show portfolio manager performance.
11. D. Sector rotation is the practice of moving
out of those industries that are heading for
a decline and into those whose fortunes are
likely to rise as the economy follows the
business cycle.

696 Series 65 Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam, 10th Edition
12. A. With the barbell strategy, the investor
would place $25,000 into bonds maturing
in 10 years and the other half into bonds
maturing in two years. This makes $25,000
available for reinvestment in two years
enabling the investor to take advantage of
the higher rates (if they materialize).
13. D. Total return is all distributions plus/minus
appreciation/depreciation. In this question,
the $1,300 includes the $250 capital gain so
all we add is the $20 dividend. $320 divided
by $1,000 equals 32% total return.
14. C. Regardless of the investment, buy and hold
is always a passive strategy. All of the others
involve some degree of continual activity
on behalf of the investor.
15. C. Although either party may enter an order,
any money or securities delivered out of
the account must be in the names of both
owners.

Insider trading is covered primarily in the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, as well as the 10(b) sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A deficiency letter is used by the SEC to extend the 20-day cooling-off period when something is missing from the registration statement. 2. D. Intrastate issues are exempt from the Securities Act of 1933 under Rule 147. U.S. government securities are always exempt. Regulation D is the private placement exemption. 3. A. This is the definition of churning. 4. C. An offer can only be made with an effective prospectus. A red herring is neither an offer to sell nor an offer of a solicitation to buy; it may only be used to obtain indications of interest. 5. B. Every prospectus carries the SEC disclaimer on the front cover in bold type. All the SEC can hope for is full disclosure of the pertinent information. 6. C. These securities are eligible for the intrastate exemption afforded under Rule 147. They might have to register in that particular state, depending on whether they met the exemption requirements in that state for that type of issue. Only under the NSMIA and the Uniform Securities Act do securities listed on a national stock exchange receive a registration exemption, as will be covered in the next session. 7. D. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires registration of securities exchanges, as well as the securities listed on those exchanges. It also requires registration of corporations whose securities are listed. All broker-dealers (other than intrastate) must register, as well as SROs, such as FINRA and the MSRB. 8. B. Choice A relates to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (not tested); Choice C relates to SIPA of 1970, which created SIPC (also not tested); and Choice D relates to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 9. C. An individual who is convicted of, or has pleaded guilty or no contest to, any felony or certain misdemeanors in the previous 10 years (120 months) is subject to statutory disqualification. A conviction made more than 10 years ago is part of the record but not cause for disqualification. A misdemeanor involving a financial matter within the past 10 years is a cause for disqualification. Accusation is not the same as conviction. 10. B. Under the Securities Act of 1933, there are two requirements for commercial paper to be exempt from registration: maturity may not exceed nine months and proceeds must be used for current operational needs. Acquiring machinery would not be considered current because the result is new fixed assets. Rating and denominations are only important under the Uniform Securities Act. 11. B. The term any person does not include the designated agent of an investment club. Groups put together for the purpose of investing together, such as an investment club or clients of an investment adviser, do not qualify. Although there are exceptions, the exam will deal with accounts for minor children only. ANSWERS AND RATIONALES 262 Series 65 Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam, 10th Edition 12. A. An investment company may own up to 3% of another investment company. Even though FINRA rules do require approval of investment company communications with the public, such approval is not part of the Investment Company Act of 1940. 13. A. Section 30(d) of the act requires semiannual reports from the fund. Although filing is required with the SEC, the company does not file with its shareholders. In the description of the types of investment companies, holding companies (which invest in other companies for the purpose of management control) are not included. 14. D.

They include any person engaged in the business of collecting, processing, or preparing for distribution or publication information dealing with transactions in, or quotations for, any nonexempt security; or distributing or publishing (whether by means of a ticker tape, a communications network, a terminal display device, or otherwise), on a current and continuing basis, information with respect to such transactions or quotations. 16. C. A prospectus deals with new issues, so the term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933. 1. A. Remember all stockholders (even preferred stockholders) are owners of a corporation, not creditors. 2. B. Preferred stock carries a fixed dividend that must be paid before any distribution to common stockholders—hence the name preferred. However, unlike the interest on a debt security, there is no obligation to pay the dividend. Therefore, the yield on a company’s preferred stock is invariably higher than that on its debt issues. Disadvantages of owning preferred stock are that the fixed return may not keep up with inflation and, regardless of corporate earnings, the dividend will not change, so there is no hope for increased income. 3. C. Debt securities, because they are an obligation of the issuer, are generally considered safer than equity securities. The only one of these debt obligations with pledged assets as security for the loan is the mortgage bond. 4. A. There are no pledged assets behind a debenture, merely the credit standing of the corporation. It is a corporate IOU. 5. D. Treasury bills are always issued at a discount, they pay no interest. The investor profits by receiving back par value and makes the difference between the discounted purchase price and the par received at maturity. All government bonds are now book entry; there has not been a Treasury note or bond issued since July 1986 with interest coupons attached. 6. D. Choice A would be correct if the question referred to Moody’s. 7. C. Although municipal bonds are sometimes exempt from state income tax (if issued in the state of residence of the taxpayer), all references to tax exemption refer to their exemption from federal income taxes. 8. B. The current yield of any security, equity, or debt is always the income return (dividend or interest) divided by the current market price. In this case, it is 5 5 110 5 . = % 9. A. Any bond selling at a premium will yield less than the coupon rate (nominal yield). Conversely, of course, a bond trading at a discount will certainly yield more. Remember, there is an inverse relationship between bond prices and bond yields. See the previous question for an example of a bond selling at a premium. 10. A. A bond that is callable has a provision that the issuer, at its option, may redeem that bond at a specified price known as the call or redemption price. 1. C. Industrial production is a coincident indicator. The stock indexes and manufacturing orders are leading indicators. Economists do not use agricultural employment as an indicator. 2. B. The CPI does not measure the increase or decrease in the level of consumer prices with respect to the level of wholesale prices. The CPI only measures retail prices whether or not wholesale prices are passed through to the consumer. 3. C. Monetarists believe that the economy and inflation are best controlled through the management of the money supply rather than through fiscal policy stimulation. 4. B. When the U.S. dollar loses value, compared with a foreign currency, the same amount of the foreign currency now buys more dollars. As a result, U.S. goods are cheaper in terms of that foreign currency, which means that the foreign country tends to buy more U.S. products and U.S. exports rise. 5. D. Foreign interest rate differentials are not reflected in an upward sloping yield curve. Interest rate differentials between countries reflect differences in domestic monetary and fiscal conditions. The time value of money is reflected in the upward sloping yield curve. Longer-term rates require higher rates to compensate for loss of current buying power and liquidity. Longerterm funds bear a higher risk of default than do shorter-term funds and, as a result, command higher rates. Increasing inflation expectations cause the yield curve to slope upward to compensate lenders for the loss of future buying power. 1. C. John’s investment in the yacht-building business suffered a loss as a result of legislative risk. In other words, the rules of the game (i.e., tax laws) changed after John purchased the security. 2. C. This imposing-looking question should take 10 seconds to do. When the question is dealing with volatility, look for the standard deviation. The portfolio with the lowest (choice C at 10.02) is the least volatile, the one with the highest (choice A at 12.25) is the most volatile. 3. C. The return from a security can be adjusted for the risk associated with it by subtracting the risk-free rate from the security’s actual return and then dividing that by its standard deviation, the basic measure of unsystematic risk. This is commonly known as the Sharpe ratio. 4. D. To determine the total return on this zerocoupon debt obligation, the $50 capital appreciation is divided by the cost of the bond, in this case $950, for a total return of 5.26%. Total return of a zero-coupon security is made up entirely of the difference between the cost of the security and its sale or maturity price. The market price of the security, not current interest rates, is used in the calculation of total return. Five percent would be the return had the debt obligation cost 100, or par. There is no coupon rate to be added to the calculation. 5. B. Duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration, the greater the change in a bond’s price with respect to interest rate changes. 6. C. The yield to maturity reflects the annualized return of a bond if it is held to its maturity. The computation reflects internal rate of return and is frequently referred to as the market required rate of return for a debt security. The rate set at issuance and printed on the face of the bond is the nominal or coupon rate. Dividing the coupon rate by the current market price of the bond provides the current yield. The return of a bond if it is held to the call date is the yield to call. 7. B. In an efficient market, all participants have equal access to information and, therefore, stock prices reflect that equality almost immediately. 8. C. The expected return is the estimate of probable returns that an investment may yield when added up. 9. A. First, compute Dan’s after-tax rate of return of 10.95% as follows: .15 × (1 − .27), or .73 = .1095. Then, compute Dan’s inflation-adjusted, or real, rate of return by subtracting the 3% inflation rate from his 10.95% after-tax return. 10. B. Because dollar-weighted returns reflect the individual investor’s cash deposits and withdrawals from the investment account, it is the preferred measure of return for them. On the other hand, time-weighted returns are generally a more important tool to show portfolio manager performance. 11. D. Sector rotation is the practice of moving out of those industries that are heading for a decline and into those whose fortunes are likely to rise as the economy follows the business cycle. 696 Series 65 Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam, 10th Edition 12. A. With the barbell strategy, the investor would place $25,000 into bonds maturing in 10 years and the other half into bonds maturing in two years. This makes $25,000 available for reinvestment in two years enabling the investor to take advantage of the higher rates (if they materialize). 13. D. Total return is all distributions plus/minus appreciation/depreciation. In this question, the $1,300 includes the $250 capital gain so all we add is the $20 dividend. $320 divided by $1,000 equals 32% total return. 14. C. Regardless of the investment, buy and hold is always a passive strategy. All of the others involve some degree of continual activity on behalf of the investor. 15. C. Although either party may enter an order, any money or securities delivered out of the account must be in the names of both owners.";
