1. A. An issuer is a person who issues a security,
whether or not the security is exempt. In
the question, the antique dealer is issuing
collectibles, not securities.
2. D. A security is any note, stock, bond, certificate
of interest, or participation in any profit
sharing arrangement, investment contract,
certificate of deposit for a security, interest in
oil, gas, or mining rights, or any investment
commonly considered a security. (Generally,
it is an investment contract wherein the
investor is passive and expects a return on
the investment through the efforts of others.)
The definition of a security does not include
direct ownership of real estate, commodities
futures contracts (e.g., corn, wheat),
collectibles, precious metals, or life insurance
or annuity contracts that have fixed payouts.

1. D. One of the benefits of this term is that these
investors do not count in the numerical
limitation placed on private placements
made under Rule 506(b). Note that for
offerings made under Rule 506(c), all
investors must be accredited. When filing
a joint return, the income requirement is
$300,000, and an employee benefit plan must
have assets in excess of $5 million. Insiders
are only considered accredited investors
when it is that issuer’s security being offered.

1. A. His 15% ownership is control. Her 5% is
not, but the fact that she is the spouse of an
affiliate makes her one, causing this to be
a sale of control stock. All sales of control
stock (unless an exemption applies) must be
accompanied by a Rule 144 filing.

1. B. Whenever the order calls for time/price
discretion, it is considered a day order and
must be executed that day. Waiting two days
is inappropriate.
2. A. University presidents are a popular choice
for serving as outside directors. Under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the term
associated person of a broker-dealer would
include an outside director of a brokerdealer and all registered personnel but not
employees who are strictly clerical and
administrative.
3. B. This is the definition of an unsolicited
transaction.

1. A. The 1975 Amendments required, for the first
time, that any firm engaged in the municipal
securities business be registered with the
SEC. Ever since 1934, broker-dealers engaged
in any phase of the securities markets have
been required to register with the SEC.
Banks (financial institutions) are members
of the MSRB but are exempt from SEC
registration.
2. C. The disclosure requirement for new issues
(IPOs) is found in the Securities Act of 1933.

1. A. Holding companies and insurance companies
are specifically excluded from the definition
of an investment company.

1. C. Closed-end companies issue a fixed number
of shares, whereas open-end companies do
not specify the number of shares to be issued.
Both types of company register issues with
the SEC, and any investor may invest in
either type of company. Open-end shares
must always be sold with a prospectus because
each is a newly issued share.
2. A. If the selling price of an investment company
is less than the NAV, the fund must be a
closed-end investment company.

1. C. The plan may be terminated by a majority
vote of the shareholders or a majority vote of
the board of directors who are noninterested
directors of the fund. A 12b-1 plan wouldn’t
work with anything other than an open-end
investment company.

1. A. The one thing that all investment companies
must do is issue common stock. That is the
form of ownership. All of the other activities
are prohibited.

1. C. Without an exemptive order from the SEC,
it would be a violation of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 for any affiliated
person to purchase any security from an
investment company other than shares of the
fund itself.
2. D. The Investment Company Act of 1940
requires that all advisory contracts contain
a provision that the contract may be
terminated upon no more than 60 days
notice in writing. The Act prohibits any
registered investment company from
owning more than 3% of the shares of
another investment company. There are
no circumstances under which an affiliated
person can borrow from the fund, and it is
not a requirement that the custodian bank
have FDIC insurance.

1. C. Any family unit may combine purchases
in as many accounts as it wishes to reach
the breakpoint for reduced sales charges.
Most often, this is spouses and custodial
accounts for minor children (there are
exceptions—not tested). If an employee of
the fund (the receptionist) purchases for
his own account, the sales charge is usually
eliminated altogether. A purchase made for a
group, such as an investment club or multiple
clients with no common purpose other than
investment, is not eligible for a reduction.

1. A. A final order, such as a suspension or
revocation, may only be entered after the
opportunity for a hearing has been granted.
2. B. Cease and desist orders are directed at
securities professionals. Stop orders are used
for securities offerings.
3. A. Governments and political subdivisions are
considered persons under the act. Remember
there are only three choices that are not a
person—minors, persons since deceased, and
those judged mentally incompetent.
4. B. In order for an employee benefit plan to be
included in the definition of institution, it
must have assets of not less than $1 million.
5. A. The USA specifies that a state’s securities
Administrator has the authority to enforce
the act in that state. A transfer agent is
the person or corporation responsible
for recording the names and holdings of
registered security owners.

1. A. A person who effects transactions in
securities for itself or for the account of
others must register in the state as a brokerdealer unless specifically excluded from the
definition or exempt from registration.
2. A. A firm with an out-of-state registration is
not considered a broker-dealer in that state if
transacting business with a customer who is
passing through the state on vacation.
3. A. If a person is excluded from the definition,
that person need not register as a brokerdealer; however, if they are not excluded (or
exempt), they must register.
4. B. When a broker-dealer is registered with both
the SEC and several states (the usual case),
the financial and operational requirements to
be met are those of the SEC.

5. C. A broker-dealer is any person, partner, officer,
director, or securities firm engaged in the
business of effecting securities transactions
for the accounts of others (broker) or for its
own account (dealer).

1. D. There is a special group of five exempt
issuers (U.S. and Canadian government
and municipal issuers; foreign governments;
banks; commercial paper; and investment
contracts related to employee benefit plans)
where an individual representing that issuer
is not an agent. This is true whether the
transaction is exempt or non-exempt. In
addition, when representing any exempt
issuer (not just the five listed), in an
exempt transaction, the individual is not an
agent. However, if the issue is not exempt
(commercial paper’s exemption is limited to
9 months) and, as the question points out,
the transaction is non-exempt, then the
individual must register as an agent of that
issuer.
2. B. All of the exclusions from the term agent
refer to an individual representing an issuer.
As long as the transaction is exempt, the
individual is not deemed to be an agent.
There is no case on the exam where an
individual performing a sales function for
a broker-dealer is not an agent. Clerical
persons are not agents, nor are officers with
no apparent sales function.
3. A. Persons must be registered as agents when
they effect transactions on behalf of brokerdealers whether or not the securities are
exempt.
4. A. Any individual taking orders on behalf of a
broker-dealer must be registered whether or
not they receive a commission.

5. B. Employees of a bank engaging in retail
sales of securities issued by that bank are
not agents regardless of how they are
compensated.
6. A. A person who represents an employer in
selling securities to employees must register as
an agent if the person receives a commission.
If no commission is paid, registration is not
necessary.
7. B. Persons who represent issuers in exempt
transactions, such as with underwriters, need
not register as agents.
8. A. A registered agent may not simultaneously
represent two different unrelated brokerdealers in the same transaction. Under
current regulations, only a few states allow
agents to have dual registrations with more
than one broker-dealer, unless those brokerdealers are under common management. In
those cases, the agent may only represent
one of the broker-dealers in any single
transaction. Agents of broker-dealers may
be simultaneously registered with real estate
agencies, insurance companies, and with two
broker-dealers, provided the broker-dealers
are under common ownership or control or
the arrangement has been authorized by the
Administrator.

1. B. A consent to service of process is filed with
the initial application and permanently
remains on file with the Administrator.
2. B. In order to do business with their Canadian
customers who are temporarily in any
state(s), Canadian broker-dealers (and
their agents) must obtain a form of limited
registration.
3. A. Whether the Form BD for a brokerdealer or the Form U-4 for an agent, the
registrant must check the box(es) listing
all jurisdictions in which the applicant is
registering (or already registered). This is also
required for investment advisers and their
representatives.

4. A. A broker-dealer, an agent, an investment
adviser representative, or a state registered
investment adviser must file a consent to
service of process with the Administrator
upon filing a registration application. The
consent to service of process gives the
Administrator the right to process legal
complaints against the applicant. In some
states, a federal covered adviser may also be
required to furnish a consent to service of
process.

1. C. The format is not what counts; it is the
content that matters.
2. C. LinkedIn is viewed as a site used far more for
business purposes than the others.

1. C. Commodity futures contracts and fixed
payment life insurance contracts are included
in our list of 6 items that are not securities.
2. C. Management activity on the part of the
owner is not part of the Howey, or four-part,
test for an instrument to be a security. The
four parts are: (1) an investment of money
in (2) a common enterprise with (3) an
expectation of profit (4) solely from the effort
of others.
3. C. Nonexempt means the security is not exempt
from the state’s registration requirements.
However, if the nonexempt security is sold
in an exempt transaction, registration is not
required.
4. B. A nonissuer transaction is one where the
company that is the issuer of the security
does not receive the proceeds from the
transaction. A nonissuer transaction is
a transaction between two investors and
may or may not require the security to be
registered depending on whether the security
or the transaction (or both) are exempt.
Whenever the proceeds go to the issuer, it is
an issuer transaction.

1. A. Registration by coordination involves
coordinating a state registration with that of
a federal registration.
2. A. Any company may register by qualification.
However, in virtually all cases, qualification
is only used when it is the only choice, such
as for intrastate offerings.
3. A. Because this offering is being made in more
than one state, SEC registration is necessary.
The state registration method would be
coordination, which is the simultaneous
registration of a security with both the SEC
and the states.
4. B. Although these are federal covered securities
and exempt from traditional registration, it
could, at the discretion of the Administrator,
be required to engage in a notice filing.

1. D. Securities issued by registered investment
companies and those sold on the NYSE
and Nasdaq Stock Market are federal
covered securities and, therefore, do not
register with the states. Commercial paper
with a maximum maturity of 270 days, in
denominations of no less than $50,000 and
a top three rating are exempt under the
Uniform Securities Act.
2. D. Variable annuities (whose performance
depends on the securities in a segregated
fund) are nonexempt, which means they
are covered by the act and have to register.
Shares in public utilities, charitable
foundations, and banking institutions that
are members of the Federal Reserve System
are included in our list of exempt securities.

3. D. The USA exempts from registration a
number of different issues. Included in that
group are securities issued by depository
institutions including a savings and
loan association that is authorized to do
business in the state. Securities issued by a
governmental unit are always exempt. Any
security senior to a common stock that is a
federal covered security is itself considered
federal covered and, therefore, exempt from
state registration.
4. B. An exempt security is exempt from the
registration requirements and the provisions
that require the filing of advertising and
sales literature. Exempt securities are never
exempt from the antifraud provisions of the
act.

1. A. Mr. Thompson’s receipt of an unsolicited
order from Ms. Gordon is an exempt
transaction.
2. A. The sale of an unregistered security in a
private, nonpublicly advertised transaction
to 10 or fewer offerees over the previous
12 months is an exempt transaction under
the limited offering exemption (a private
placement).
3. A. Any transaction by an executor,
administrator, sheriff, marshal, receiver,
trustee in bankruptcy, guardian, or
conservator (but not a custodian for a minor
under UTMA) is considered an exempt
transaction under the Uniform Securities
Act.
4. B. The sale of stock of a previously privately
owned company to the public in an initial
public offering is not an exempt transaction.
5. C. Choice III is not an exempt transaction
because the private placement exemption
is limited to 10 offerees, not 10 purchasers.
The Administrator would be suspicious of
anyone with a 100% closing ratio. All of
the others are included in our list of exempt
transactions.

6. D. The purchase of securities from a brokerdealer by an employee of a bank is a
nonexempt transaction—it is a sale of a
security by a broker-dealer to a member
of the public and is therefore not exempt.
Transactions between broker-dealers
and issuers as part of an underwriting
commitment; transactions between banks;
and transactions between banks and
insurance companies are exempt because
they are transactions between financial
institutions. Exempt transactions are most
often identified by who the transaction is
with rather than what type of security is
involved.
7. C. Both unsolicited transactions and
transactions between issuers and underwriters
are exempt transactions, not exempt
securities. U.S. government securities
and securities of credit unions are exempt
securities, not exempt transactions.
8. D. An agent who sells any security to an
insurance company is engaged in an exempt
transaction that is not bound by the
advertising and registration requirements of
the USA. Any sale to certain institutional
customers, such as banks, investment
companies, and insurance companies, is
an exempt transaction. Neither exempt
securities nor exempt transactions must
adhere to the registration and advertising
provisions of the USA. This is an exempt
transaction because of the nature of the
purchaser, not the type of security being sold.

1. A. A registration statement may be filed by the
issuer, any other person on whose behalf the
offering is to be made, or a registered brokerdealer.

1. A. It is unlawful to guarantee the performance
of any security. Even though repayment of
the principal of the government securities at
maturity is assured, the same cannot be said
about the mutual fund.

2. A. It is unlawful to exercise discretion without
prior written authorization. Because the
client was a nondiscretionary client, the
agent could not, on his own initiative, select
which internet company to invest in.
3. B. An agent must refuse orders from anyone
other than the customer unless that person
has prior written trading authority.
4. A. All written customer complaints must be
forwarded to a designated supervisor of the
agent’s employing broker-dealer.
5. B. Agents may borrow from clients who are
banks or financial institutions that are in
the business of lending money to public
customers. Agents may not borrow money
from customers who are not in the business of
lending money.
6. A. An agent may not guarantee the performance
of a security.
7. B. It is lawful to charge extra transaction fees
when justified as long as the customer is
informed before the transaction.
8. A. It is unlawful to promise services that an
agent cannot reasonably expect to perform or
that the agent is not qualified to perform.
9. A. It is unlawful to solicit unregistered
nonexempt securities.
10. C. A wash trade, the practice of attempting
to create the appearance of trading activity
by entering offsetting buy and sell orders,
is a form of market manipulation. Matched
orders or matched purchases occur when
market participants agree to buy and sell
securities among themselves to create the
appearance of heightened market activity;
this is also a form of market manipulation.
Although churning is a prohibited practice,
it does not involve manipulating the market,
and arbitrage is the perfectly legal practice
of buying a security in one marketplace and
simultaneously selling it in another to benefit
from a price disparity.

11. D. It is permissible to sell rights, which are
securities. Borrowing money or securities
from other than a bank or broker-dealer in
the business of lending, failing to identify
a customer’s financial objectives, and
guaranteeing a customer’s account against
losses are all prohibited practices.
12. D. Failure to bring customers’ written
complaints to the attention of the agent’s
broker-dealer is prohibited.
13. D. The use of information, such as a rumor, that
has no basis in fact is prohibited.
14. A. An agent may indicate that a security is
registered or is exempt from registration. All
of the other statements are prohibited.
15. D. Recommending tax shelters to low-income
retirees is an example of an unsuitable
transaction. Stating that an Administrator
has approved an offering on the basis of the
quality of information in the prospectus,
soliciting orders for unregistered nonexempt
securities, and employing a device to defraud
are all prohibited practices under the USA.

1. D. The Administrator has jurisdiction over
a security offering if it was directed to,
originated in, or was accepted in that state.
2. C. A state Administrator has jurisdiction
over a securities offering made in a bona
fide newspaper published within the
state, but only whose circulation is not more
than X\c outside the state.
3. C. An offer is made in an attempt to sell; a
sale is the binding contract to sell a security
for value. An offer will not require prior
approval, but a designated supervisory
individual must approve all sales on the date
the order is executed.

1. D. The Administrator need not seek an
injunction to issue a cease and desist
order. The USA does not require that an
Administrator conduct a public or private
hearing before issuing a cease and desist
order. When time does not permit, the
Administrator may issue a cease and desist
before a hearing to prevent a pending
violation. The USA does not grant the
Administrator the power to issue injunctions
to force compliance with the act. The act
permits the Administrator to issue cease and
desist orders, and, if they do not work, the
Administrator may seek an injunction from
a court of competent jurisdiction. A cease
and desist order is an administrative order,
whereas an injunction is a judicial order.
2. C. An Administrator may compel the
testimony of witnesses when conducting
an investigation. Investigation of serious
violations need not be held in public.
An Administrator in Illinois may enforce
subpoenas from South Carolina whether
or not the violation occurred in Illinois.
Conviction for any felony within the past 10
years is one of a number of reasons that the
Administrator has for denying a license.
3. B. The Administrator can deny, suspend, or
revoke a registration for many reasons, but
they must be in the interest of the public.
The Administrator may not deny the
registration simply because it is prudent.
The Administrator may determine that
an applicant is not qualified to act as an
adviser and thus limit the registration to
that of a broker-dealer; the Administrator
can also take into consideration whether the
registrant will work under the supervision
of a registered investment adviser or brokerdealer when approving an application. Lack
of experience is insufficient for denial.
4. B. An arrest warrant can only be issued by a
court of law.

1. D. An administrator may cancel the
registration of a registrant that is no longer
in existence. A person may request a
withdrawal of a registration. Withdrawals
become effective after 30 days if there are
no revocation or denial proceedings in
process. An Administrator does not revoke
the registration of a person who is declared
mentally incompetent but instead cancels
his registration; this is a nonpunitive
administrative action.

1. B. To be subject to time in prison, a sales
agent must knowingly have violated the
USA. A client who purchased a security
in violation of the USA may recover the
original purchase price plus costs involved
in filing a lawsuit. In addition, the purchaser
is entitled to interest at a rate stated by the
Administrator, less any earnings already
received on the investment. The right of
rescission must be accepted within 30 days of
receipt of the letter of rescission. Although
any person aggrieved by an order of the
Administrator may request an appeal of the
order within 60 days, such appeal does not
function as a stay order during the appeal
process. The person who is the subject of the
order must comply with the order during the
period unless a stay is granted by the court.
2. C. For an agent to have civil liability, a sale
must take place. If the offer is made using
a statement like the one in this question
and a sale subsequently occurs, a client
suffering a loss would be able to sue. Even
though one may never claim approval by
the Administrator, there is no civil liability
unless the client has some kind of a claim.
However, even though the client cannot
bring a case, the Administrator could bring
a disciplinary action against the agent for
making this claim. On a law exam, you must
be careful to understand who has a claim and
when they do. 

3. B. Under the USA, the maximum penalty is a
fine of $5,000 and/or 3 years in jail.
4. A. The Administrator may issue a cease and
desist order without a hearing, but does not
have the authority to convict violators of the
1933 Securities Act in criminal prosecutions
or sentence violators of the USA. The
Administrator may suspend a security’s
effective registration upon subsequently
discovering that an officer of the firm has
been convicted of a securities-related crime,
not a nonsecurities-related one.
5. B. It is a NASAA Model Rule that brokerdealers operating on the premises of a
financial institution make certain disclosures.
Every attempt should be made to locate
separately from the banking operation and
to obtain something in writing from the
clients indicating that they have received
the disclosures. It is not necessary that there
be any relationship between the BD and the
institution other than a business one.
6. D. Persons who are convicted of violating
securities laws may find themselves subject
to criminal penalties, civil liabilities,
and suspension, denial, or revocation of
registration.

1. B. This is the term used in both the federal
and state law. OSJ is a FINRA term and
has no relevance to investment advisers. In
fact, it may be the home office or executive
office, but the exam will be looking for their
definition.

1. B. The act specifically excludes accountants,
lawyers, any professional engineer
(aeronautical, civil, mechanical, or others),
and teachers. Economists are not included in
this listing.
2. B. There is an exclusion from the definition for
all banks, regardless of what they do. Also
excluded are persons whose advice relates
only to securities that are direct obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States—it
makes no difference who their clients are.
A geologist is not excluded because the
law only specifies 4 professional exclusions:
accountants, attorneys, engineers, and
teachers.
3. C. Publishers of general circulation newspapers
and magazines are excluded from the
definition of investment adviser, even if the
entire publication is devoted to investment
advice. An important key here is that it
is published regularly, not upon market
events. A broker-dealer loses its exclusion
the moment it offers advice for a separate
charge, as does an attorney who holds
herself out as offering investment advice.
Normally, a teacher is excluded, but not
when charging for advice as would appear to
be the case here. On this examination, the
term comprehensive financial planning always
includes securities advice.
4. B Only those individuals in the business of
giving advice on securities are required to
register as investment advisers; only the
convertible bonds are securities.

1. A. Advisers who only service insurance
companies are exempt, as are advisers
performing intrastate who do not give advice
on listed securities (municipal bonds are not
listed). Advising banks only does not qualify
one for the exemption.

1. B. Publishers of newspapers and magazines
of general circulation that offer general
financial advice need not register.
2. A. Broker-dealers must register as investment
advisers if they receive special or separate
compensation for giving investment advice.
3. A. An investment adviser that manages less
than $100 million in assets must register as
an investment adviser under the USA. If the
client is an investment company registered
under the Investment Company Act of
1940, registration with the SEC is mandatory
regardless of amount under management.
4. C. This is the straightforward definition of
an IA. Yes, an IA does act in a fiduciary
capacity, but are all fiduciaries investment
advisers? No.
5. B. Unless some kind of exemption applies, an
investment adviser must register on the state
level if it manages less than $100 million
in assets. Publishers of general circulation
books are exempt from state registration,
as are advisers with no offices in the state
whose only customers are institutions, such
as banks and investment companies, in the
state. Investment advisers with $110 million
or more in assets under management
must register with the SEC, not the state
Administrator regardless of offices in the
state and the type of clientele being served.

1. A. Because Mr. Oldman has been responsible
for updating the ADV, it is logical to assume
that he is the contact person for information
regarding the form. His sudden retirement
means the firm would have to appoint a new
contact person. This is a change that the
SEC deems necessary to promptly amend of
the Form ADV. Amendments to the ADV
may not be done using Form ADV-W—that
is for withdrawal only.
2. D. Any entity meeting the definition of a person
would be eligible to file for registration as an
investment adviser on Form ADV

1. C. In order to use the term investment counsel, 2
criteria must be met— the principal business
must be giving investment advice and the
adviser must provide investment supervisory
services. Running model portfolios for clients
would meet both requirements. The financial
planner is not principally in the business
of offering investment advice because he
describes his service as offering a wide range
of services, of which advice is only one part.
The exam frequently uses that wording to
indicate that advice is not the principal
activity. While the publisher’s principal
business activity may be offering advice,
nothing about the description indicates
that individual client accounts are being
monitored.
2. B. Reasons for cancellation do not include
dropping below a minimum number of
clients. Revocation of registration is usually
connected with some form of disciplinary
action. Insolvency is not cause for revocation
or cancellation under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, although it is cause
under the Uniform Securities Act.

1. B. Advisers maintaining discretion over client
accounts are required to have a minimum net
worth of $10,000. No, we haven’t covered
the information dealing with choice D yet,
but this is a good opportunity to learn a testtaking technique. You will sometimes find
an answer choice you have never heard of
before. It might be correct, especially if it
is an “all of these are true except” question.
But, don’t pick an answer just because
you don’t know what it means. And, in a
question like this, where you should have
easily spotted that the correct net worth is
$10,000 instead of $35,000, before you go on
to the next question, make a mental note (or
write down on the pad given to you), the fact
you learn from choice D—it might show up
on another question.
2. C. Under the USA, an investment adviser
exercising discretion over client accounts
must maintain minimum net worth of
$10,000. If the adviser falls below that
minimum, it must notify the Administrator
by the close of business the following day.
Then, a complete financial report must be
furnished to the Administrator by the close
of business the day following the sending of
the notice. Unless otherwise instructed by
the Administrator, the firm may continue to
exercise discretion.
3. C. The USA requires advisers who take custody
to maintain a minimum net worth of
$35,000. Any Administrator is empowered
to change that number, higher or lower. As
long as an investment adviser meets the net
worth requirements of the state where its
principal office is located, there is no need
to be concerned about any other state’s
requirements.
4. D. Whenever there is a material change to the
information contained in the registration
application of a securities professional, the
Administrator must be promptly notified.
Marital status is not included on the Form
U-4. Federal covered investment advisers are
not under the Administrator’s jurisdiction.

1. F. An investment adviser (not the investment
adviser representative) must register with
the SEC if the firm manages assets of
$110 million or more. As a representative
of a federal covered investment adviser, the
individual would have to be registered as an
investment adviser representative in each
state where she maintains a place of business.
2. T. An adviser maintaining custody, whether
or not discretion is involved, is generally
required to maintain a net worth of $35,000.
3. F. An employee of an investment advisory firm
is not an investment adviser representative if
his duties are confined to clerical activities.
4. F. Any administrative employee who receives
specific compensation for offering investment
advisory services is considered an investment
adviser representative.
5. T. Any employee of an investment advisory
firm is an investment adviser representative
if his duties involve making investment
recommendations.
6. A. A financial planning firm or other
person that, as an integral component
of other financially related services,
provides investment advisory services for
compensation is an investment adviser.
A publisher of a bona fide newspaper,
news magazine, or business or financial
publication of general and regular circulation
and a federal covered investment adviser
are excluded from the definition of an
investment adviser. Obviously, if the
Administrator excludes a person from the
definition, they’re not going to have to
register. Likewise, if the Administrator were
to include that person, registration would be
required. 

7. C. Clerical and ministerial personnel are
specifically excluded from the definition
of investment adviser representative.
Specifically included in the definition are
directors, officers, partners, associates, and
employees of state registered advisers who
carry out investment advisory or solicitation
functions or who supervise those functions.
Also included in the definition are persons
who perform similar functions for SECregistered advisers and who have a place of
business in the state. Once there is a place of
business in the state, the de minimis rule no
longer applies.

1. D. This is the exception, since the records must
be kept for 5 years. Nothing in the question
asked about the 2-year requirement in the
office. The 5-year requirement is that records
be easily accessible whether in the office or
not.
2. D. Records of an investment adviser must be
maintained for five years. Records are subject
to surprise audits by the state Administrator,
written records may be reduced to microfilm,
and records originally created on a company’s
computer may be stored in electronic media.

1. D. An adviser to investment companies and
an adviser who provides only impersonal
advisory services are specifically listed as
being exempt from the delivery requirements
of the brochure rule (impersonal advice with
a charge of $500 or more would require an
offer to deliver). An adviser who provides
advice only to insurance companies is
exempt from registration as an investment
adviser and therefore would also be exempt
from the requirements of the brochure.

2. D. Delivery of the ADV Part 2A, or brochure,
must be made to each client no later than the
commencement of the advisory agreement.
If the adviser wishes to deliver prior to that,
there is no problem, but it is not required.
For a state registered adviser, there is a
requirement to deliver the brochure at least
48 hours in advance, unless the contract calls
for a penalty-free termination. The ADV
Part 1 is used when registering and is not
furnished to clients.
3. D. This is one of the purposes of ADV Part 2B,
the brochure supplement. Justification for
SEC registration is based on assets under
management, not the number of clients, and
the brochure is not required to disclose the
number of clients served by the investment
adviser.
4. D. The balance sheet is required only when
the adviser receives prepayments in excess
of $1,200 for periods of 6 months or
longer—not for those maintaining custody.
If this had been a state registered adviser,
the conditions are different in that the
substantial prepayment amount requiring
a balance sheet is $500 instead of $1,200
and NASAA Model Rules also require a
balance sheet to all clients for whom the IA
maintains custody.
5. D. The brochure rule requires that each client
be given a written disclosure statement
by the adviser no later than the time of
entering into the advisory agreement. It
may consist of a copy of Part 2A and 2B of
Form ADV or another document providing
similar information. There are no minimum
net worth requirements for SEC registered
investment advisers.

1. A. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
discretion and substantial prepayments are
not considered custody. Access to funds in
the client’s account is one of the standard
tenets of custody.
2. C. If an IA is registered or is registering with
one or more of the state securities authorities,
the dollar amount reporting threshold for
including the required balance sheet is more
than $500 in fees per client, six months
or more in advance. Unlike the federal
law, under state law, a balance sheet is also
required whenever the IA maintains custody
of client assets. When the custodian is an
affiliated broker-dealer (as in this case),
the balance sheet requirement is triggered.
When the only reason one is considered to
have custody is automatic debiting of fees,
the balance sheet is not normally required.
Yes, there are certain conditions to be met
to qualify for this exception, but on the
exam, in a question like this, you may assume
they’re met.
3. A. Taking custody is considered to be of
such significance that it requires prompt
notification to the Administrator by
the investment adviser by updating the
Form ADV. Using a qualified custodian still
constitutes a form of custody and requires
notification to the Administrator.
4. B. Whether custody is maintained by the
investment adviser itself or by a qualified
custodian, statements must be sent at least
quarterly.
5. D. If the adviser does not return the securities to
the sender within 3 business days, the adviser
not only has actual custody, but has also
violated the rule’s requirement that client
securities be maintained in an account with a
qualified custodian.

6. A. NASAA lists 3 acceptable qualified
custodians. They are (1) a bank or savings
association that has deposits insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; (2) a
registered broker-dealer holding the client
assets in customer accounts; and (3) a foreign
financial institution that customarily holds
financial assets for its customers, provided
that the foreign financial institution keeps
the advisory clients’ assets in customer
accounts segregated from its proprietary
assets.
7. C. Under the NASAA Model Custody Rule,
whenever an investment adviser receives
customer checks made payable to an
unrelated third party, failure to forward
the check to that third party within 3
business days of receipt is considered to be
maintaining custody. Unlike the other cases
where the money or securities are returned
to the client, third party checks must be
forwarded.
8. D. Surety bonds are never required under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, although
they may be required under the Uniform
Securities Act. The audit must be a surprise.
The adviser only informs the client about
the client’s securities, not everybody else’s
securities held by the adviser.

1. A. Material disciplinary violations must be
reported by all investment advisers, regardless
of whether they keep custody. The first 2
answers fit the definition of material actions,
but not the third. If the suit goes in favor
of the client and the adviser is found guilty,
disclosure would need to be made. However,
there is something that investment advisers
who do not maintain custody or receive
substantial prepayments avoid having to do.
What is that? They do not have to notify
their clients about any financial situation
that might impair their ability to meet
contractual commitments to clients.

1. B. Hedge clauses may not be used to disclaim
statements that are inherently misleading.
2. C. The regulators have not objected to
clauses that limit the investment adviser’s
liability for losses caused by conditions
and events beyond its control, such
as war, strikes, natural disasters, new
government restrictions, market fluctuations,
communications disruptions, and so forth.
Such provisions are acceptable since they do
not attempt to limit or misstate the adviser’s
fiduciary obligations to its clients. Limiting
liability to acts done in bad faith might
cause the unsophisticated client to fail to
understand that he still has a right to take
action, even when the acts are committed in
good faith. Fiduciary responsibility cannot be
limited by hedge clauses.

1. C. Investment advisers never file anything with
the SEC unless it relates to Form ADV. Past
specific recommendations may be shown as
long as they include all recommendations
covering at least the prior 12-month period
and contain a disclaimer regarding any
assurance of future results.
2. C. With its principal office in New Jersey,
PPA only has to meet the financial and
recordkeeping requirements of that state.
However, any business done in Connecticut,
including advertising, comes under that
state’s jurisdiction. SEC requirements are
bogus because this is not a federal covered
adviser and the Administrator of any state in
which the IA is registered can pull a surprise
visit during business hours.
3. A. One of the criteria for using the term
investment counsel is that the adviser’s
primary business is providing investment
advice. It is always prohibited to make
an untrue statement, whether or not the
fact is material, and one can never imply
government approval of one’s abilities.

4. A. An investment adviser may never put his
own interests before those of customers. The
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not
prohibit employment with a broker-dealer
and serving as an investment adviser. Any
conflict of interests must be disclosed to the
client. An adviser is not prohibited from
investing in the same securities transactions
as recommended to clients.
5. B. It is permissible to post general information
about an investment adviser on a public
website, which comes under the definition
of advertising. Advertising implies that the
publisher of the material has no control over
who may view it. Thus, recommendations
of specific securities, including managed
products, are prohibited because it is
not possible to determine the suitability
of specific investments for unknown
viewers. The SEC and NASAA prohibit
client testimonials in investment adviser
advertising.

1. C. A client’s contracts, whether written or oral
(technically, the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 does not require written contracts), may
not be assigned without the client’s consent
under any circumstances. If the adviser is a
partnership, notice must be made to clients
of any changes in the membership of the
partnership within a reasonable period. It is
always permitted to charge a fee based on the
average value of assets under management.
2. B. The addition of 2 equal partners to a
5-person firm does not constitute a majority
change so all that is necessary is notice
within a reasonable period of time, not
consent. In the case of a corporation, a
change in stock ownership is never required
to be disclosed unless there is an actual
change to the control or management
of the adviser and such is not indicated
here. Pledging a majority stock interest in
an adviser structured as a corporation is
considered an assignment and, therefore,
requires client consent.

3. A. An adviser’s fee may not be based on
portfolio appreciation or capital gains, except
under certain circumstances that are not
detailed in the question. Advisory fees may
be based on a percentage of assets under
management. There should be no question
on the exam where “waiving” something will
be permitted.
4. D. Under the Uniform Securities Act, custody
indicates that the adviser has physical
possession over its clients’ certificates and
monies. If there is a rule prohibiting it,
no investment adviser registered in that
state can act in contravention of that rule.
A prohibition against custody in a given
state does not prohibit the adviser from
holding investment discretion over clients’
accounts, provided such discretion is granted
under a suitable authorization or power
of attorney. Merely examining customers’
stock certificates is certainly not the same
as holding custody or possession of such
certificates. As long as the affiliation is
disclosed, there is nothing improper about an
IA referring advisory clients to that affiliated
BD.

1. B. To make cash payments to solicitors, the
agreement must:
■ be in writing;
■ provide for disclosure of any affiliations
between the adviser and the solicitor
(unless the solicitation is being made
for impersonal advisory service);
■ provide that no one subject to statutory disqualification be compensated;
■ follow a script approved by the adviser;
and
■ provide that, in addition to the adviser’s brochure, a solicitor brochure be
delivered as well (3rd party).
 Nothing in the rules refers at all to how
much of the adviser’s time must be spent
giving advice. The only time there is a
requirement that a substantial portion of the
adviser’s business be giving investment advice
is when using the term investment counsel.

2. B. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and
the associated SEC rules do not require the
solicitor to register as an investment adviser
representative as long as the solicitor’s
activities are strictly limited to merely
referring clients to a registered investment
adviser in compliance with SEC rules.
However, the majority of state securities
regulators define the solicitation or referral of
investment advisory clients as an investment
advisory activity requiring the registration
of the solicitor as an investment adviser
or investment adviser representative. But
remember to read the question—it only asks
about the federal law.

1. C. Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for those
expenses paid with soft dollars that offer a
direct research benefit. Rent is not included
in the list of acceptable items coming under
that safe harbor.
2. D. Soft-dollar compensation is when an
investment adviser derives an economic
benefit from the use of a client’s commission
dollars. Software of the type mentioned here
is allowable under the safe harbor provisions
of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. It is true that this is indirect
compensation and that this is a discretionary
account, but the answer that best matches
the question is soft dollar. Many times on the
exam, you have to select best of the choices
given.

3. B. The SEC requires prior written discretionary
authorization, whereas The NASAA Model
Rule on Unethical Business Practices Of
Investment Advisers, Investment Adviser
Representatives, and Federal Covered
Advisers only requires that the written
document be received no later than 10
business days after the first transaction in
the account. Discretionary orders must be
promptly reviewed, but not before placing
the order. Even with the NSMIA, the
Administrator has the power to take action
against any federal covered adviser operating
in the state where there is a belief that
fraudulent action has taken place.
4. B. Full-service brokerage firms often provide
research reports, securities and portfolio
analysis, and special reports without specific
charges, but are usually compensated by their
higher commissions. Nothing in industry
rules prevents an adviser from using a fullservice broker to effect customer transactions.
However, it would be unethical if the adviser
were to benefit personally from the direction
of the client business.

1. C. The USA does not require investment
advisers to include in their contracts a list
of those states in which they are licensed to
do business. The USA does require advisers
to include their method of computing fees,
a statement prohibiting assignment without
client consent, and notification of change in
membership of the investment partnership.
2. F. An Administrator may, by rule or order,
prevent an adviser from taking custody.
If an Administrator prevents custody, an
adviser cannot overrule the Administrator by
notifying the Administrator first.
3. F. An adviser may sell securities to clients from
its own account provided disclosure is made
upon receipt of consent from the client
before completion of the trade.
4. T. Investment advisers are bound by the
regulations that apply to sales activities as
well as those that apply to advisory activities. 

1. D. Although any securities professional
handing a customer account is obligated to
follow all necessary procedures to protect
client data, customers themselves also bear
a responsibility. Customers ignoring the
cybersecurity safeguards put not only their
own data at risk, but also that of other
customers, by potentially opening the door to
hackers.
2. A. It is hard to imagine how the music on hold
would present a security risk. All of the
others clearly offer potential for loss.
3. D. An investment adviser (or broker-dealer)
must give a customer 30 days to implement
any opt-out provision in the privacy notice.

let rawExplanations = " 1. A. An issuer is a person who issues a security, whether or not the security is exempt. In the question, the antique dealer is issuing collectibles, not securities. 2. D. A security is any note, stock, bond, certificate of interest, or participation in any profit sharing arrangement, investment contract, certificate of deposit for a security, interest in oil, gas, or mining rights, or any investment commonly considered a security. (Generally, it is an investment contract wherein the investor is passive and expects a return on the investment through the efforts of others.) The definition of a security does not include direct ownership of real estate, commodities futures contracts (e.g., corn, wheat), collectibles, precious metals, or life insurance or annuity contracts that have fixed payouts. 1. D. One of the benefits of this term is that these investors do not count in the numerical limitation placed on private placements made under Rule 506(b). Note that for offerings made under Rule 506(c), all investors must be accredited. When filing a joint return, the income requirement is $300,000, and an employee benefit plan must have assets in excess of $5 million. Insiders are only considered accredited investors when it is that issuer’s security being offered. 1. A. His 15% ownership is control. Her 5% is not, but the fact that she is the spouse of an affiliate makes her one, causing this to be a sale of control stock. All sales of control stock (unless an exemption applies) must be accompanied by a Rule 144 filing. 1. B. Whenever the order calls for time/price discretion, it is considered a day order and must be executed that day. Waiting two days is inappropriate. 2. A. University presidents are a popular choice for serving as outside directors. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the term associated person of a broker-dealer would include an outside director of a brokerdealer and all registered personnel but not employees who are strictly clerical and administrative. 3. B. This is the definition of an unsolicited transaction. 1. A. The 1975 Amendments required, for the first time, that any firm engaged in the municipal securities business be registered with the SEC. Ever since 1934, broker-dealers engaged in any phase of the securities markets have been required to register with the SEC. Banks (financial institutions) are members of the MSRB but are exempt from SEC registration. 2. C. The disclosure requirement for new issues (IPOs) is found in the Securities Act of 1933. 1. A. Holding companies and insurance companies are specifically excluded from the definition of an investment company. 1. C. Closed-end companies issue a fixed number of shares, whereas open-end companies do not specify the number of shares to be issued. Both types of company register issues with the SEC, and any investor may invest in either type of company. Open-end shares must always be sold with a prospectus because each is a newly issued share. 2. A. If the selling price of an investment company is less than the NAV, the fund must be a closed-end investment company. 1. C. The plan may be terminated by a majority vote of the shareholders or a majority vote of the board of directors who are noninterested directors of the fund. A 12b-1 plan wouldn’t work with anything other than an open-end investment company. 1. A. The one thing that all investment companies must do is issue common stock. That is the form of ownership. All of the other activities are prohibited. 1. C. Without an exemptive order from the SEC, it would be a violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for any affiliated person to purchase any security from an investment company other than shares of the fund itself. 2. D. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that all advisory contracts contain a provision that the contract may be terminated upon no more than 60 days notice in writing. The Act prohibits any registered investment company from owning more than 3% of the shares of another investment company. There are no circumstances under which an affiliated person can borrow from the fund, and it is not a requirement that the custodian bank have FDIC insurance. 1. C. Any family unit may combine purchases in as many accounts as it wishes to reach the breakpoint for reduced sales charges. Most often, this is spouses and custodial accounts for minor children (there are exceptions—not tested). If an employee of the fund (the receptionist) purchases for his own account, the sales charge is usually eliminated altogether. A purchase made for a group, such as an investment club or multiple clients with no common purpose other than investment, is not eligible for a reduction. 1. A. A final order, such as a suspension or revocation, may only be entered after the opportunity for a hearing has been granted. 2. B. Cease and desist orders are directed at securities professionals. Stop orders are used for securities offerings. 3. A. Governments and political subdivisions are considered persons under the act. Remember there are only three choices that are not a person—minors, persons since deceased, and those judged mentally incompetent. 4. B. In order for an employee benefit plan to be included in the definition of institution, it must have assets of not less than $1 million. 5. A. The USA specifies that a state’s securities Administrator has the authority to enforce the act in that state. A transfer agent is the person or corporation responsible for recording the names and holdings of registered security owners. 1. A. A person who effects transactions in securities for itself or for the account of others must register in the state as a brokerdealer unless specifically excluded from the definition or exempt from registration. 2. A. A firm with an out-of-state registration is not considered a broker-dealer in that state if transacting business with a customer who is passing through the state on vacation. 3. A. If a person is excluded from the definition, that person need not register as a brokerdealer; however, if they are not excluded (or exempt), they must register. 4. B. When a broker-dealer is registered with both the SEC and several states (the usual case), the financial and operational requirements to be met are those of the SEC. 5. C. A broker-dealer is any person, partner, officer, director, or securities firm engaged in the business of effecting securities transactions for the accounts of others (broker) or for its own account (dealer). 1. D. There is a special group of five exempt issuers (U.S. and Canadian government and municipal issuers; foreign governments; banks; commercial paper; and investment contracts related to employee benefit plans) where an individual representing that issuer is not an agent. This is true whether the transaction is exempt or non-exempt. In addition, when representing any exempt issuer (not just the five listed), in an exempt transaction, the individual is not an agent. However, if the issue is not exempt (commercial paper’s exemption is limited to 9 months) and, as the question points out, the transaction is non-exempt, then the individual must register as an agent of that issuer. 2. B. All of the exclusions from the term agent refer to an individual representing an issuer. As long as the transaction is exempt, the individual is not deemed to be an agent. There is no case on the exam where an individual performing a sales function for a broker-dealer is not an agent. Clerical persons are not agents, nor are officers with no apparent sales function. 3. A. Persons must be registered as agents when they effect transactions on behalf of brokerdealers whether or not the securities are exempt. 4. A. Any individual taking orders on behalf of a broker-dealer must be registered whether or not they receive a commission. 5. B. Employees of a bank engaging in retail sales of securities issued by that bank are not agents regardless of how they are compensated. 6. A. A person who represents an employer in selling securities to employees must register as an agent if the person receives a commission. If no commission is paid, registration is not necessary. 7. B. Persons who represent issuers in exempt transactions, such as with underwriters, need not register as agents. 8. A. A registered agent may not simultaneously represent two different unrelated brokerdealers in the same transaction. Under current regulations, only a few states allow agents to have dual registrations with more than one broker-dealer, unless those brokerdealers are under common management. In those cases, the agent may only represent one of the broker-dealers in any single transaction. Agents of broker-dealers may be simultaneously registered with real estate agencies, insurance companies, and with two broker-dealers, provided the broker-dealers are under common ownership or control or the arrangement has been authorized by the Administrator. 1. B. A consent to service of process is filed with the initial application and permanently remains on file with the Administrator. 2. B. In order to do business with their Canadian customers who are temporarily in any state(s), Canadian broker-dealers (and their agents) must obtain a form of limited registration. 3. A. Whether the Form BD for a brokerdealer or the Form U-4 for an agent, the registrant must check the box(es) listing all jurisdictions in which the applicant is registering (or already registered). This is also required for investment advisers and their representatives. 4. A. A broker-dealer, an agent, an investment adviser representative, or a state registered investment adviser must file a consent to service of process with the Administrator upon filing a registration application. The consent to service of process gives the Administrator the right to process legal complaints against the applicant. In some states, a federal covered adviser may also be required to furnish a consent to service of process. 1. C. The format is not what counts; it is the content that matters. 2. C. LinkedIn is viewed as a site used far more for business purposes than the others. 1. C. Commodity futures contracts and fixed payment life insurance contracts are included in our list of 6 items that are not securities. 2. C. Management activity on the part of the owner is not part of the Howey, or four-part, test for an instrument to be a security. The four parts are: (1) an investment of money in (2) a common enterprise with (3) an expectation of profit (4) solely from the effort of others. 3. C. Nonexempt means the security is not exempt from the state’s registration requirements. However, if the nonexempt security is sold in an exempt transaction, registration is not required. 4. B. A nonissuer transaction is one where the company that is the issuer of the security does not receive the proceeds from the transaction. A nonissuer transaction is a transaction between two investors and may or may not require the security to be registered depending on whether the security or the transaction (or both) are exempt. Whenever the proceeds go to the issuer, it is an issuer transaction. 1. A. Registration by coordination involves coordinating a state registration with that of a federal registration. 2. A. Any company may register by qualification. However, in virtually all cases, qualification is only used when it is the only choice, such as for intrastate offerings. 3. A. Because this offering is being made in more than one state, SEC registration is necessary. The state registration method would be coordination, which is the simultaneous registration of a security with both the SEC and the states. 4. B. Although these are federal covered securities and exempt from traditional registration, it could, at the discretion of the Administrator, be required to engage in a notice filing. 1. D. Securities issued by registered investment companies and those sold on the NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market are federal covered securities and, therefore, do not register with the states. Commercial paper with a maximum maturity of 270 days, in denominations of no less than $50,000 and a top three rating are exempt under the Uniform Securities Act. 2. D. Variable annuities (whose performance depends on the securities in a segregated fund) are nonexempt, which means they are covered by the act and have to register. Shares in public utilities, charitable foundations, and banking institutions that are members of the Federal Reserve System are included in our list of exempt securities. 3. D. The USA exempts from registration a number of different issues. Included in that group are securities issued by depository institutions including a savings and loan association that is authorized to do business in the state. Securities issued by a governmental unit are always exempt. Any security senior to a common stock that is a federal covered security is itself considered federal covered and, therefore, exempt from state registration. 4. B. An exempt security is exempt from the registration requirements and the provisions that require the filing of advertising and sales literature. Exempt securities are never exempt from the antifraud provisions of the act. 1. A. Mr. Thompson’s receipt of an unsolicited order from Ms. Gordon is an exempt transaction. 2. A. The sale of an unregistered security in a private, nonpublicly advertised transaction to 10 or fewer offerees over the previous 12 months is an exempt transaction under the limited offering exemption (a private placement). 3. A. Any transaction by an executor, administrator, sheriff, marshal, receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, guardian, or conservator (but not a custodian for a minor under UTMA) is considered an exempt transaction under the Uniform Securities Act. 4. B. The sale of stock of a previously privately owned company to the public in an initial public offering is not an exempt transaction. 5. C. Choice III is not an exempt transaction because the private placement exemption is limited to 10 offerees, not 10 purchasers. The Administrator would be suspicious of anyone with a 100% closing ratio. All of the others are included in our list of exempt transactions. 6. D. The purchase of securities from a brokerdealer by an employee of a bank is a nonexempt transaction—it is a sale of a security by a broker-dealer to a member of the public and is therefore not exempt. Transactions between broker-dealers and issuers as part of an underwriting commitment; transactions between banks; and transactions between banks and insurance companies are exempt because they are transactions between financial institutions. Exempt transactions are most often identified by who the transaction is with rather than what type of security is involved. 7. C. Both unsolicited transactions and transactions between issuers and underwriters are exempt transactions, not exempt securities. U.S. government securities and securities of credit unions are exempt securities, not exempt transactions. 8. D. An agent who sells any security to an insurance company is engaged in an exempt transaction that is not bound by the advertising and registration requirements of the USA. Any sale to certain institutional customers, such as banks, investment companies, and insurance companies, is an exempt transaction. Neither exempt securities nor exempt transactions must adhere to the registration and advertising provisions of the USA. This is an exempt transaction because of the nature of the purchaser, not the type of security being sold. 1. A. A registration statement may be filed by the issuer, any other person on whose behalf the offering is to be made, or a registered brokerdealer. 1. A. It is unlawful to guarantee the performance of any security. Even though repayment of the principal of the government securities at maturity is assured, the same cannot be said about the mutual fund. 2. A. It is unlawful to exercise discretion without prior written authorization. Because the client was a nondiscretionary client, the agent could not, on his own initiative, select which internet company to invest in. 3. B. An agent must refuse orders from anyone other than the customer unless that person has prior written trading authority. 4. A. All written customer complaints must be forwarded to a designated supervisor of the agent’s employing broker-dealer. 5. B. Agents may borrow from clients who are banks or financial institutions that are in the business of lending money to public customers. Agents may not borrow money from customers who are not in the business of lending money. 6. A. An agent may not guarantee the performance of a security. 7. B. It is lawful to charge extra transaction fees when justified as long as the customer is informed before the transaction. 8. A. It is unlawful to promise services that an agent cannot reasonably expect to perform or that the agent is not qualified to perform. 9. A. It is unlawful to solicit unregistered nonexempt securities. 10. C. A wash trade, the practice of attempting to create the appearance of trading activity by entering offsetting buy and sell orders, is a form of market manipulation. Matched orders or matched purchases occur when market participants agree to buy and sell securities among themselves to create the appearance of heightened market activity; this is also a form of market manipulation. Although churning is a prohibited practice, it does not involve manipulating the market, and arbitrage is the perfectly legal practice of buying a security in one marketplace and simultaneously selling it in another to benefit from a price disparity. 11. D. It is permissible to sell rights, which are securities. Borrowing money or securities from other than a bank or broker-dealer in the business of lending, failing to identify a customer’s financial objectives, and guaranteeing a customer’s account against losses are all prohibited practices. 12. D. Failure to bring customers’ written complaints to the attention of the agent’s broker-dealer is prohibited. 13. D. The use of information, such as a rumor, that has no basis in fact is prohibited. 14. A. An agent may indicate that a security is registered or is exempt from registration. All of the other statements are prohibited. 15. D. Recommending tax shelters to low-income retirees is an example of an unsuitable transaction. Stating that an Administrator has approved an offering on the basis of the quality of information in the prospectus, soliciting orders for unregistered nonexempt securities, and employing a device to defraud are all prohibited practices under the USA. 1. D. The Administrator has jurisdiction over a security offering if it was directed to, originated in, or was accepted in that state. 2. C. A state Administrator has jurisdiction over a securities offering made in a bona fide newspaper published within the state, but only whose circulation is not more than X\c outside the state. 3. C. An offer is made in an attempt to sell; a sale is the binding contract to sell a security for value. An offer will not require prior approval, but a designated supervisory individual must approve all sales on the date the order is executed. 1. D. The Administrator need not seek an injunction to issue a cease and desist order. The USA does not require that an Administrator conduct a public or private hearing before issuing a cease and desist order. When time does not permit, the Administrator may issue a cease and desist before a hearing to prevent a pending violation. The USA does not grant the Administrator the power to issue injunctions to force compliance with the act. The act permits the Administrator to issue cease and desist orders, and, if they do not work, the Administrator may seek an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction. A cease and desist order is an administrative order, whereas an injunction is a judicial order. 2. C. An Administrator may compel the testimony of witnesses when conducting an investigation. Investigation of serious violations need not be held in public. An Administrator in Illinois may enforce subpoenas from South Carolina whether or not the violation occurred in Illinois. Conviction for any felony within the past 10 years is one of a number of reasons that the Administrator has for denying a license. 3. B. The Administrator can deny, suspend, or revoke a registration for many reasons, but they must be in the interest of the public. The Administrator may not deny the registration simply because it is prudent. The Administrator may determine that an applicant is not qualified to act as an adviser and thus limit the registration to that of a broker-dealer; the Administrator can also take into consideration whether the registrant will work under the supervision of a registered investment adviser or brokerdealer when approving an application. Lack of experience is insufficient for denial. 4. B. An arrest warrant can only be issued by a court of law. 1. D. An administrator may cancel the registration of a registrant that is no longer in existence. A person may request a withdrawal of a registration. Withdrawals become effective after 30 days if there are no revocation or denial proceedings in process. An Administrator does not revoke the registration of a person who is declared mentally incompetent but instead cancels his registration; this is a nonpunitive administrative action. 1. B. To be subject to time in prison, a sales agent must knowingly have violated the USA. A client who purchased a security in violation of the USA may recover the original purchase price plus costs involved in filing a lawsuit. In addition, the purchaser is entitled to interest at a rate stated by the Administrator, less any earnings already received on the investment. The right of rescission must be accepted within 30 days of receipt of the letter of rescission. Although any person aggrieved by an order of the Administrator may request an appeal of the order within 60 days, such appeal does not function as a stay order during the appeal process. The person who is the subject of the order must comply with the order during the period unless a stay is granted by the court. 2. C. For an agent to have civil liability, a sale must take place. If the offer is made using a statement like the one in this question and a sale subsequently occurs, a client suffering a loss would be able to sue. Even though one may never claim approval by the Administrator, there is no civil liability unless the client has some kind of a claim. However, even though the client cannot bring a case, the Administrator could bring a disciplinary action against the agent for making this claim. On a law exam, you must be careful to understand who has a claim and when they do. 3. B. Under the USA, the maximum penalty is a fine of $5,000 and/or 3 years in jail. 4. A. The Administrator may issue a cease and desist order without a hearing, but does not have the authority to convict violators of the 1933 Securities Act in criminal prosecutions or sentence violators of the USA. The Administrator may suspend a security’s effective registration upon subsequently discovering that an officer of the firm has been convicted of a securities-related crime, not a nonsecurities-related one. 5. B. It is a NASAA Model Rule that brokerdealers operating on the premises of a financial institution make certain disclosures. Every attempt should be made to locate separately from the banking operation and to obtain something in writing from the clients indicating that they have received the disclosures. It is not necessary that there be any relationship between the BD and the institution other than a business one. 6. D. Persons who are convicted of violating securities laws may find themselves subject to criminal penalties, civil liabilities, and suspension, denial, or revocation of registration. 1. B. This is the term used in both the federal and state law. OSJ is a FINRA term and has no relevance to investment advisers. In fact, it may be the home office or executive office, but the exam will be looking for their definition. 1. B. The act specifically excludes accountants, lawyers, any professional engineer (aeronautical, civil, mechanical, or others), and teachers. Economists are not included in this listing. 2. B. There is an exclusion from the definition for all banks, regardless of what they do. Also excluded are persons whose advice relates only to securities that are direct obligations of or guaranteed by the United States—it makes no difference who their clients are. A geologist is not excluded because the law only specifies 4 professional exclusions: accountants, attorneys, engineers, and teachers. 3. C. Publishers of general circulation newspapers and magazines are excluded from the definition of investment adviser, even if the entire publication is devoted to investment advice. An important key here is that it is published regularly, not upon market events. A broker-dealer loses its exclusion the moment it offers advice for a separate charge, as does an attorney who holds herself out as offering investment advice. Normally, a teacher is excluded, but not when charging for advice as would appear to be the case here. On this examination, the term comprehensive financial planning always includes securities advice. 4. B. Only those individuals in the business of giving advice on securities are required to register as investment advisers; only the convertible bonds are securities. 1. A. Advisers who only service insurance companies are exempt, as are advisers performing intrastate who do not give advice on listed securities (municipal bonds are not listed). Advising banks only does not qualify one for the exemption. 1. B. Publishers of newspapers and magazines of general circulation that offer general financial advice need not register. 2. A. Broker-dealers must register as investment advisers if they receive special or separate compensation for giving investment advice. 3. A. An investment adviser that manages less than $100 million in assets must register as an investment adviser under the USA. If the client is an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, registration with the SEC is mandatory regardless of amount under management. 4. C. This is the straightforward definition of an IA. Yes, an IA does act in a fiduciary capacity, but are all fiduciaries investment advisers? No. 5. B. Unless some kind of exemption applies, an investment adviser must register on the state level if it manages less than $100 million in assets. Publishers of general circulation books are exempt from state registration, as are advisers with no offices in the state whose only customers are institutions, such as banks and investment companies, in the state. Investment advisers with $110 million or more in assets under management must register with the SEC, not the state Administrator regardless of offices in the state and the type of clientele being served. 1. A. Because Mr. Oldman has been responsible for updating the ADV, it is logical to assume that he is the contact person for information regarding the form. His sudden retirement means the firm would have to appoint a new contact person. This is a change that the SEC deems necessary to promptly amend of the Form ADV. Amendments to the ADV may not be done using Form ADV-W—that is for withdrawal only. 2. D. Any entity meeting the definition of a person would be eligible to file for registration as an investment adviser on Form ADV 1. C. In order to use the term investment counsel, 2 criteria must be met— the principal business must be giving investment advice and the adviser must provide investment supervisory services. Running model portfolios for clients would meet both requirements. The financial planner is not principally in the business of offering investment advice because he describes his service as offering a wide range of services, of which advice is only one part. The exam frequently uses that wording to indicate that advice is not the principal activity. While the publisher’s principal business activity may be offering advice, nothing about the description indicates that individual client accounts are being monitored. 2. B. Reasons for cancellation do not include dropping below a minimum number of clients. Revocation of registration is usually connected with some form of disciplinary action. Insolvency is not cause for revocation or cancellation under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, although it is cause under the Uniform Securities Act. 1. B. Advisers maintaining discretion over client accounts are required to have a minimum net worth of $10,000. No, we haven’t covered the information dealing with choice D yet, but this is a good opportunity to learn a testtaking technique. You will sometimes find an answer choice you have never heard of before. It might be correct, especially if it is an “all of these are true except” question. But, don’t pick an answer just because you don’t know what it means. And, in a question like this, where you should have easily spotted that the correct net worth is $10,000 instead of $35,000, before you go on to the next question, make a mental note (or write down on the pad given to you), the fact you learn from choice D—it might show up on another question. 2. C. Under the USA, an investment adviser exercising discretion over client accounts must maintain minimum net worth of $10,000. If the adviser falls below that minimum, it must notify the Administrator by the close of business the following day. Then, a complete financial report must be furnished to the Administrator by the close of business the day following the sending of the notice. Unless otherwise instructed by the Administrator, the firm may continue to exercise discretion. 3. C. The USA requires advisers who take custody to maintain a minimum net worth of $35,000. Any Administrator is empowered to change that number, higher or lower. As long as an investment adviser meets the net worth requirements of the state where its principal office is located, there is no need to be concerned about any other state’s requirements. 4. D. Whenever there is a material change to the information contained in the registration application of a securities professional, the Administrator must be promptly notified. Marital status is not included on the Form U-4. Federal covered investment advisers are not under the Administrator’s jurisdiction. 1. B. An investment adviser (not the investment adviser representative) must register with the SEC if the firm manages assets of $110 million or more. As a representative of a federal covered investment adviser, the individual would have to be registered as an investment adviser representative in each state where she maintains a place of business. 2. A. An adviser maintaining custody, whether or not discretion is involved, is generally required to maintain a net worth of $35,000. 3. B. An employee of an investment advisory firm is not an investment adviser representative if his duties are confined to clerical activities. 4. B. Any administrative employee who receives specific compensation for offering investment advisory services is considered an investment adviser representative. 5. A. Any employee of an investment advisory firm is an investment adviser representative if his duties involve making investment recommendations. 6. A. A financial planning firm or other person that, as an integral component of other financially related services, provides investment advisory services for compensation is an investment adviser. A publisher of a bona fide newspaper, news magazine, or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation and a federal covered investment adviser are excluded from the definition of an investment adviser. Obviously, if the Administrator excludes a person from the definition, they’re not going to have to register. Likewise, if the Administrator were to include that person, registration would be required. 7. C. Clerical and ministerial personnel are specifically excluded from the definition of investment adviser representative. Specifically included in the definition are directors, officers, partners, associates, and employees of state registered advisers who carry out investment advisory or solicitation functions or who supervise those functions. Also included in the definition are persons who perform similar functions for SECregistered advisers and who have a place of business in the state. Once there is a place of business in the state, the de minimis rule no longer applies. 1. D. This is the exception, since the records must be kept for 5 years. Nothing in the question asked about the 2-year requirement in the office. The 5-year requirement is that records be easily accessible whether in the office or not. 2. D. Records of an investment adviser must be maintained for five years. Records are subject to surprise audits by the state Administrator, written records may be reduced to microfilm, and records originally created on a company’s computer may be stored in electronic media. 1. D. An adviser to investment companies and an adviser who provides only impersonal advisory services are specifically listed as being exempt from the delivery requirements of the brochure rule (impersonal advice with a charge of $500 or more would require an offer to deliver). An adviser who provides advice only to insurance companies is exempt from registration as an investment adviser and therefore would also be exempt from the requirements of the brochure. 2. D. Delivery of the ADV Part 2A, or brochure, must be made to each client no later than the commencement of the advisory agreement. If the adviser wishes to deliver prior to that, there is no problem, but it is not required. For a state registered adviser, there is a requirement to deliver the brochure at least 48 hours in advance, unless the contract calls for a penalty-free termination. The ADV Part 1 is used when registering and is not furnished to clients. 3. D. This is one of the purposes of ADV Part 2B, the brochure supplement. Justification for SEC registration is based on assets under management, not the number of clients, and the brochure is not required to disclose the number of clients served by the investment adviser. 4. D. The balance sheet is required only when the adviser receives prepayments in excess of $1,200 for periods of 6 months or longer—not for those maintaining custody. If this had been a state registered adviser, the conditions are different in that the substantial prepayment amount requiring a balance sheet is $500 instead of $1,200 and NASAA Model Rules also require a balance sheet to all clients for whom the IA maintains custody. 5. D. The brochure rule requires that each client be given a written disclosure statement by the adviser no later than the time of entering into the advisory agreement. It may consist of a copy of Part 2A and 2B of Form ADV or another document providing similar information. There are no minimum net worth requirements for SEC registered investment advisers. 1. A. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, discretion and substantial prepayments are not considered custody. Access to funds in the client’s account is one of the standard tenets of custody. 2. C. If an IA is registered or is registering with one or more of the state securities authorities, the dollar amount reporting threshold for including the required balance sheet is more than $500 in fees per client, six months or more in advance. Unlike the federal law, under state law, a balance sheet is also required whenever the IA maintains custody of client assets. When the custodian is an affiliated broker-dealer (as in this case), the balance sheet requirement is triggered. When the only reason one is considered to have custody is automatic debiting of fees, the balance sheet is not normally required. Yes, there are certain conditions to be met to qualify for this exception, but on the exam, in a question like this, you may assume they’re met. 3. A. Taking custody is considered to be of such significance that it requires prompt notification to the Administrator by the investment adviser by updating the Form ADV. Using a qualified custodian still constitutes a form of custody and requires notification to the Administrator. 4. B. Whether custody is maintained by the investment adviser itself or by a qualified custodian, statements must be sent at least quarterly. 5. D. If the adviser does not return the securities to the sender within 3 business days, the adviser not only has actual custody, but has also violated the rule’s requirement that client securities be maintained in an account with a qualified custodian. 6. A. NASAA lists 3 acceptable qualified custodians. They are (1) a bank or savings association that has deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; (2) a registered broker-dealer holding the client assets in customer accounts; and (3) a foreign financial institution that customarily holds financial assets for its customers, provided that the foreign financial institution keeps the advisory clients’ assets in customer accounts segregated from its proprietary assets. 7. C. Under the NASAA Model Custody Rule, whenever an investment adviser receives customer checks made payable to an unrelated third party, failure to forward the check to that third party within 3 business days of receipt is considered to be maintaining custody. Unlike the other cases where the money or securities are returned to the client, third party checks must be forwarded. 8. D. Surety bonds are never required under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, although they may be required under the Uniform Securities Act. The audit must be a surprise. The adviser only informs the client about the client’s securities, not everybody else’s securities held by the adviser. 1. A. Material disciplinary violations must be reported by all investment advisers, regardless of whether they keep custody. The first 2 answers fit the definition of material actions, but not the third. If the suit goes in favor of the client and the adviser is found guilty, disclosure would need to be made. However, there is something that investment advisers who do not maintain custody or receive substantial prepayments avoid having to do. What is that? They do not have to notify their clients about any financial situation that might impair their ability to meet contractual commitments to clients. 1. B. Hedge clauses may not be used to disclaim statements that are inherently misleading. 2. C. The regulators have not objected to clauses that limit the investment adviser’s liability for losses caused by conditions and events beyond its control, such as war, strikes, natural disasters, new government restrictions, market fluctuations, communications disruptions, and so forth. Such provisions are acceptable since they do not attempt to limit or misstate the adviser’s fiduciary obligations to its clients. Limiting liability to acts done in bad faith might cause the unsophisticated client to fail to understand that he still has a right to take action, even when the acts are committed in good faith. Fiduciary responsibility cannot be limited by hedge clauses. 1. C. Investment advisers never file anything with the SEC unless it relates to Form ADV. Past specific recommendations may be shown as long as they include all recommendations covering at least the prior 12-month period and contain a disclaimer regarding any assurance of future results. 2. C. With its principal office in New Jersey, PPA only has to meet the financial and recordkeeping requirements of that state. However, any business done in Connecticut, including advertising, comes under that state’s jurisdiction. SEC requirements are bogus because this is not a federal covered adviser and the Administrator of any state in which the IA is registered can pull a surprise visit during business hours. 3. A. One of the criteria for using the term investment counsel is that the adviser’s primary business is providing investment advice. It is always prohibited to make an untrue statement, whether or not the fact is material, and one can never imply government approval of one’s abilities. 4. A. An investment adviser may never put his own interests before those of customers. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not prohibit employment with a broker-dealer and serving as an investment adviser. Any conflict of interests must be disclosed to the client. An adviser is not prohibited from investing in the same securities transactions as recommended to clients. 5. B. It is permissible to post general information about an investment adviser on a public website, which comes under the definition of advertising. Advertising implies that the publisher of the material has no control over who may view it. Thus, recommendations of specific securities, including managed products, are prohibited because it is not possible to determine the suitability of specific investments for unknown viewers. The SEC and NASAA prohibit client testimonials in investment adviser advertising. 1. C. A client’s contracts, whether written or oral (technically, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not require written contracts), may not be assigned without the client’s consent under any circumstances. If the adviser is a partnership, notice must be made to clients of any changes in the membership of the partnership within a reasonable period. It is always permitted to charge a fee based on the average value of assets under management. 2. B. The addition of 2 equal partners to a 5-person firm does not constitute a majority change so all that is necessary is notice within a reasonable period of time, not consent. In the case of a corporation, a change in stock ownership is never required to be disclosed unless there is an actual change to the control or management of the adviser and such is not indicated here. Pledging a majority stock interest in an adviser structured as a corporation is considered an assignment and, therefore, requires client consent. 3. A. An adviser’s fee may not be based on portfolio appreciation or capital gains, except under certain circumstances that are not detailed in the question. Advisory fees may be based on a percentage of assets under management. There should be no question on the exam where “waiving” something will be permitted. 4. D. Under the Uniform Securities Act, custody indicates that the adviser has physical possession over its clients’ certificates and monies. If there is a rule prohibiting it, no investment adviser registered in that state can act in contravention of that rule. A prohibition against custody in a given state does not prohibit the adviser from holding investment discretion over clients’ accounts, provided such discretion is granted under a suitable authorization or power of attorney. Merely examining customers’ stock certificates is certainly not the same as holding custody or possession of such certificates. As long as the affiliation is disclosed, there is nothing improper about an IA referring advisory clients to that affiliated BD. 1. B. To make cash payments to solicitors, the agreement must: ■ be in writing; ■ provide for disclosure of any affiliations between the adviser and the solicitor (unless the solicitation is being made for impersonal advisory service); ■ provide that no one subject to statutory disqualification be compensated; ■ follow a script approved by the adviser; and ■ provide that, in addition to the adviser’s brochure, a solicitor brochure be delivered as well (3rd party). Nothing in the rules refers at all to how much of the adviser’s time must be spent giving advice. The only time there is a requirement that a substantial portion of the adviser’s business be giving investment advice is when using the term investment counsel. 2. B. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the associated SEC rules do not require the solicitor to register as an investment adviser representative as long as the solicitor’s activities are strictly limited to merely referring clients to a registered investment adviser in compliance with SEC rules. However, the majority of state securities regulators define the solicitation or referral of investment advisory clients as an investment advisory activity requiring the registration of the solicitor as an investment adviser or investment adviser representative. But remember to read the question—it only asks about the federal law. 1. C. Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for those expenses paid with soft dollars that offer a direct research benefit. Rent is not included in the list of acceptable items coming under that safe harbor. 2. D. Soft-dollar compensation is when an investment adviser derives an economic benefit from the use of a client’s commission dollars. Software of the type mentioned here is allowable under the safe harbor provisions of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It is true that this is indirect compensation and that this is a discretionary account, but the answer that best matches the question is soft dollar. Many times on the exam, you have to select best of the choices given. 3. B. The SEC requires prior written discretionary authorization, whereas The NASAA Model Rule on Unethical Business Practices Of Investment Advisers, Investment Adviser Representatives, and Federal Covered Advisers only requires that the written document be received no later than 10 business days after the first transaction in the account. Discretionary orders must be promptly reviewed, but not before placing the order. Even with the NSMIA, the Administrator has the power to take action against any federal covered adviser operating in the state where there is a belief that fraudulent action has taken place. 4. B. Full-service brokerage firms often provide research reports, securities and portfolio analysis, and special reports without specific charges, but are usually compensated by their higher commissions. Nothing in industry rules prevents an adviser from using a fullservice broker to effect customer transactions. However, it would be unethical if the adviser were to benefit personally from the direction of the client business. 1. C. The USA does not require investment advisers to include in their contracts a list of those states in which they are licensed to do business. The USA does require advisers to include their method of computing fees, a statement prohibiting assignment without client consent, and notification of change in membership of the investment partnership. 2. B. An Administrator may, by rule or order, prevent an adviser from taking custody. If an Administrator prevents custody, an adviser cannot overrule the Administrator by notifying the Administrator first. 3. B. An adviser may sell securities to clients from its own account provided disclosure is made upon receipt of consent from the client before completion of the trade. 4. A. Investment advisers are bound by the regulations that apply to sales activities as well as those that apply to advisory activities. 1. D. Although any securities professional handing a customer account is obligated to follow all necessary procedures to protect client data, customers themselves also bear a responsibility. Customers ignoring the cybersecurity safeguards put not only their own data at risk, but also that of other customers, by potentially opening the door to hackers. 2. A. It is hard to imagine how the music on hold would present a security risk. All of the others clearly offer potential for loss. 3. D. An investment adviser (or broker-dealer) must give a customer 30 days to implement any opt-out provision in the privacy notice.";
