Most stock prices remain relatively stable and fluctuate up and down within a narrow range. The lower limit to these fluctuations is called a support level - the price point where a stock appears cheap and attracts buyers. The upper limit is called a resistance level - the price point where a stock appears expensive and initiates selling. Generally, a support level will develop after a stock has experienced a steady decline from a higher price level. Technicians believe that, at some price below the recent peak, other investors will buy who did not buy prior to the first price increase and have been waiting for a small reversal to get into the stock. When the price reaches this support level, demand surges and price and volume begin to increase again.",

Multiplying the $1,000 par value times 103% six times (there are six semiannual adjustments in three years) results in a principal value just over $1,194. Because the 4% coupon rate is paid semiannually, the payment at the end of three years will be the adjusted principal of $1,194 times 2%, and that equals $23.88. For testing purposes, you can always arrive at the correct answer by using simple instead of compounded interest. That is, with a 6% annual inflation rate, the bond's principal will increase by $60 per year for three years. That would make the adjusted principal $1,180. Take 2% of that and the result is $23.60.

You would respond, saying A. there is probably a misprint in the paper and, more than likely, the asking price is $11.22, making the sales charge 8.5% B. that this is probably an unregistered hedge fund not subject to SEC rules C. the KAPLOW Fund is a closed-end company whose selling price is not based upon NAV, as is the case with an open-end fund D. the KAPLOW Fund is being investigated by the SEC for being sold with a sales charge in excess of the 8.5% maximum limit 115. Ways in which a Section 529 plan differs from a Coverdell ESA include I. tax-free distributions when the funds are used for qualifying educational expenses. II. higher contribution limits III. no earnings limitations IV. contributions that may be made by someone other than a parent or legal guardian A. I and IV B. II and IV C. I and II D. II and III 116. Which of the following classes of mutual fund shares would be appropriate for an investor who doesn't mind paying some sales charges on a purchase, but wants to minimize operating expenses over a long-term holding period? A. Class B shares B. No-load shares C. Class A shares D. Class C shares 117. In October 1987, the SEC promulgated Release IA-1092, which had the effect of broadening the definition of investment adviser. As a result of the release, which of the following would be included in the definition? I. Commercial banks offering comprehensive financial planning for their high net worth clients II. Entertainment agents earning a fee for negotiating contracts for their clients and then placing a portion of the client's royalties into investment-grade bonds or large-cap stocks as market conditions dictate III. Persons being compensated for assisting employee benefit plan administrators in selecting investment managers for the plan's assets IV. Lawyers who prepare trust agreements for clients with large securities holdings, with a goal of minimizing estate taxes A. II and III B. I and II C. I and IV D. II and IV 118. John Jones purchased 100 shares of DEF common stock at a price of $25 per share on August 4, 2020. On December 1, 2021, with the stock selling for $29 per share, he gifted the stock to his daughter. She subsequently sold the stock nine months later for $32 per share. Her tax consequence is A. $300 short-term capital gain B. $700 short-term capital gain C. $300 long-term capital gain D. $700 long-term capital gain 119. One form of commodity investing is the purchase of precious metals. An investor in precious metals would be least likey to purchase A. platinum. B. gold. C. molybdenum. D. palladium. 120. One of the purposes of filing the annual updating amendment to the Form ADV Part 1A is to A. verify that the investment adviser still qualifies for SEC registration B. ensure that full disclosure has been made in the adviser's brochure C. disclose the amount and location of securities or funds of clients that are being held by the adviser or a qualified custodian D. provide updated information on those associated persons who are in charge of giving investment advice 121.

Which of these forms of business structure carries the greatest personal liability? A. LLC B. Limited partnership C. S corporation D. Sole proprietorship 123. Once reaching the age of 72, required minimum distributions must be taken for retired individuals who were participants in all of the following EXCEPT A. Keogh plans B. SEP IRAs C. traditional IRAs D. Roth IRAs 124. Gerald has been a client of yours for more than a decade. Over that period, the relationship expanded from a business one to one of a social nature, including attending events with your respective spouses. One afternoon, Gerald's wife calls explaining that she just got off the phone with Gerald. Before hanging up, he asked her to contact you with a sell order in his account. Having had extensive social contact, you recognize her voice and know that their marriage is on strong footing. You should A. accept the order because you know the wife and understand that this is something that would be fine with Gerald B. contact your compliance department, explain the relationship, and wait for further instructions C. explain that you cannot accept an order from anyone other than the account holder without having written trading authorization D. email a copy of the trading authorization form and ask her to electronically sign for Gerald and return it so that you can place the order. 125. A technical analyst who has been charting the common stock of Kloud Information Storage Systems (KISS) would most likely sell KISS stock short when the market price of the stock is A. just above the support level. B. below the support level. C. above the resistance level. D. just below the resistance level. 126. Historically, common stock has been shown to protect against A. inflation risk B. business risk C. market risk D. systematic risk 127. Under the Uniform Securities Act, an investment adviser would have to disclose that the firm was acting in a principal capacity when A. engaging in an agency cross transaction B. selling shares from its proprietary account to an advisory client C. directing a securities transaction to an affiliated broker-dealer D. the trade was being executed by an officer or partner of the firm 128.

Under certain conditions, an Administrator may prohibit a broker-dealer registered in the state from accepting any unsolicited orders. C. A client may not purchase, at his own initiative, securities trading in the secondary market if the agent is otherwise prohibited from soliciting the order. D. An unsolicited order from a noninstitutional client for an unregistered, nonexempt security is considered a transaction exempt from the registration and advertising filing requirements of the act. 129. One of your clients is a widow with three grown children. She wants the assets in her account to go to her children upon her death—50% to her daughter and 25% to each of her sons. She does not want the estate to have to deal with probate on these assets. How should her account be set up? A. Joint tenants with right of survivorship B. Tenants in common C. Transfer on death D. Tenants in the entirety 130. If a portfolio manager wished to reduce inflation risk, which of the following would be most appropriate to add to the portfolio? A. AAA bonds B. Tangible assets C. Preferred stock D. Fixed annuities 131. You have a client who is interested in a preferred stock whose dividends are guaranteed. What is likely the reason for using that term? A. The issuer has a AAA rating that is tantamount to dividend payments being a sure thing. B. Someone other than the issuer has guaranteed the payment of those dividends. C. A previous IAR has improperly used that term in an effort to make a sale. D. As a fixed income security, the dividends are guaranteed to never increase. 132. Fiscal policy, as implemented by Congress and the administration, would entail all of the following EXCEPT A. running a budget deficit B. changing tax rates C. changing the discount rate D. increasing military spending 133. One of the major goals of most hedge funds is to A. generate liberal tax write-offs for their investors B. appeal to the sophisticated investor C. use long and short strategies to provide a stable return in both up and down markets. D. generate higher fees for their advisers 134. An individual has just received an inheritance of $15,000 and has the goals of preservation of capital and income. The client is in a low tax bracket. Which of the following would be the most suitable choice? A. Bank-insured CDs B. Newly issued U.S. Treasury bonds C. Public utility stocks D. Insured municipal bonds 135. Each of the following would be exempt from the definition of an agent under the Uniform Securities Act EXCEPT A. Katrina, the administrator of the Widget Spinners Corporation pension plan, who is paid for making investment decisions for the portfolio B. Florence, an employee of the First Fidelity Trust Company, who buys and sells securities to meet the needs of her trust clients C. Beatrice, who was appointed by the other members of her investment club to make the portfolio decisions for the next quarter D. Violet, an employee of the Widget Spinners Corporation, who is paid a commission on sales of the company stock to fellow employees 136. Looking at the balance sheet, a corporation builds its capital structure with all of the following except A. long-term debt. B. retained earnings. C. capital stock. D. cash. 137. Under which of the following asset allocation programs is it most likely that commission expense will have a significant impact on portfolio performance? A. Strategic B. Buy and hold C. Rebalancing D. Tactical 138. Which of the following is the primary advantage to the employer who offers a nonqualified plan when compared to one that offers a qualified plan? A. The qualified plan is permitted to discriminate in favor of key employees. B. The qualified plan costs less to administer than the nonqualified plan. C. The nonqualified plan allows for an immediate employer deduction for contributions. D. The nonqualified plan is permitted to discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. 139. An investor has returns of 4%, 5%, and 9% over a three-year period. What is the investor's arithmetic mean? A. 18% B. 5% C. 7% D. 6% 140. With regard to the NASAA Model Brochure Rule Requirements for Investment Advisers, which of the following are not exempt from the delivery requirements of that rule? A. An adviser who only provides impersonal advisory services at an annual charge of less than $500 B. An adviser who deals with qualified clients only C. An adviser whose only clients are closed-end investment companies D. An adviser whose only clients are exchange-traded funds";
let rawExplanations = " 1. B. The discounted cash flow method considers the future expected free cash flow (the interest payments plus the eventual return of the principal) and discounting it to arrive at a present value. In its simplest iteration, this is nothing more than taking all the money you are scheduled to receive over a given future period and adjusting that for the time value of money. In general, bonds with higher coupons will have the greatest value because they will clearly produce the most cash flow, and zero-coupon bonds will produce the lowest because they have no cash flow other than the return of the face value at maturity. 2. B. A conversion feature is a benefit to the bondholder. It allows the bondholder a choice to either continue holding the debt represented by the bond or to convert the bond into shares of common stock of the underlying issuer. Everything that is done in the securities industry has to be a win-win situation. The win for the bondholder in this instance is the ability to take advantage of the capital appreciation potential the common stock may offer, and the win for the issuer is that by offering something extra to the bond purchaser, the bond purchaser is willing to accept a lower interest rate on the bond (as compared to a nonconvertible bond), and therefore, giving the issuer a lower cost of capital. 3. A. Research reports, whether prepared by the firm or by a third party, fall within the safe harbor provisions of Section 28(e). Software used to analyze securities is also permissible since that benefits the client. Tax preparation software benefits the adviser, but not the client. 4. D. Trusts can be set up to run for many years; the executor's job is over once the estate has been settled. 5. C. On any joint account, it is required to obtain suitability information on all of the account owners. 6. B. First of all, this is an SEC registered IA, so we have to go by the federal numbers. Those are more than $1,200, six or more months in advance. The $600 would have been substantial if PACE was state-registered. Although the other two choices are above $1,200, they are not prepaid for at least six months. 7. A. Anything that will bring foreign money to the U.S. will decrease the balance of payments. Foreign investors pulling their money out of the U.S. or investing less in the U.S. will increase the deficit. 8. C. For those concerned about the effects of interest rate fluctuations on their portfolio, increasing the length of the maturities would increase, rather than decrease, the risk. 9. B. As an IAR with a federal covered investment adviser, Daphna only has to register in those states in which she maintains a place of business. That means registering in States D and E. The number of clients is irrelevant. 10. A. State-registered investment advisers who do not deliver the brochure at least 48 hours prior to entering the contract must offer a penalty-free withdrawal of five days. There is nothing comparable to that in the federal law. Both have the 120-day delivery requirement, and state-registered investment advisers cannot have investment companies as clients. 11. A. The weak form implies that information contained in historical stock prices is fully incorporated into current stock prices; therefore, technical analysis (the study of historical prices and volume) is not worthwhile in predicting future prices. This form neither refutes fundamental analysis nor implies that traders using insider information cannot earn superior profits. 12. D. Although there are closed-end funds that invest in alternative investments, those are in the minority. The other choices are all clearly labeled as alternatives. 13. B. Commissions can be received only by those with the appropriate registrations. A nonregistered person cannot participate in transactional-based compensation. 14. A. The ability to convert into the company's common stock enables holders of convertible preferred stock to participate in the company's growth. With rare exception, there is no maturity date on preferred stock. Preferred stock does offer a fixed return, but so does any debt security issued by the company, and it is only debt securities, where the interest is a tax-deductible expense, where the issuer receives a tax benefit. 15. B. If an adviser states that fees are negotiable but charges his fixed rates, that would be an unfair business practice. Time and price are not considered discretion. 16. B. Securities issued by the U.S. Treasury are, at least for exam purposes, free of default or credit risk, but, as with all fixed-income securities, are subject to interest rate risk and inflation or purchasing power risk. Any marketable security is subject to market risk. 17. A. The de minimis rule for a registered investment adviser who has no place of business in the state is fewer than six retail clients. Doing business with six clients within the past 12 months exceeds this de minimis amount and, therefore, the exemption from registration does not exist. All others listed as possible answers are institutional- or professional-type investment clients. If a registered investment adviser works only with this type of client, an exemption from registration in that state exists as long as the registered investment adviser has no place of business in that state. In fact, if the investment adviser deals exclusively with registered investment companies, the adviser is federal covered and must register with the SEC rather than any states. 18. B. An investor's time horizon is the length of time the planned investment strategy is designed to serve. In the case of a couple looking ahead to retirement, the time horizon is their life expectancy. 19. B. A growing trend in investment circles is socially responsible investing. Those clients are expressing their values or attitudes. 20. C. The large-cap stocks are generally the most conservative when looking for growth. Adding 25% small-cap stocks to the mix adds the small extra risk the investor indicated she was willing to assume. 21. D. As with so many suitability questions, students frequently have to sit back and try to find a logical answer. Although the risk tolerance for all of these choices tends to be on the lower end of the scale, banks are different when it comes to liquidity needs. Banks tend to have high liquidity needs because they must be ready to meet withdrawals at any time by depositors. The nature of foundations, trusts, and defined benefit pension plans is such that they typically have lower liquidity needs than banks. 22. D. Once the firm's net worth is below $35,000, notifications and reports must be sent to the Administrator. Unless ordered by the Administrator, there is no requirement to return client assets to them. 23. C. Two of the major risks faced by DPP investors are the lack of liquidity and the possibility of legislative change. 24. A. The conviction on Johnson's record is for a misdemeanor. The fact that the same crime is a felony in another state is not relevant to his application for registration in that state. 25. D. The question is looking for a leading indicator and, of the list, only new building permits fits. Industrial production is a coincident indicator, while the other two choices are lagging. 26. C. The computation for tax equivalent yield is found by dividing the municipal bond's coupon rate (7%) by (100% - tax bracket) or (100% - 35%). When dividing 7% by.65, the result is closest to 10.77%. In other words, an investor would have to receive a taxable return in excess of 10.77% to put more money in the pocket than owning this 7% municipal bond 27. D. The Dodd-Frank Act tells us that we're referring to federal law. Although investment advisers dealing solely with insurance companies are exempt from registration, that is not the private fund exemption the question is asking about. 28. B. Value managers look for value, as found on the company's financial statements. 29. B. A sale by certain fiduciaries, such as an executor or administrator of an estate, is an exempt transaction under the USA. Even though the Treasury bonds are an exempt security, the sale to an individual is not an exempt transaction. Rule 506(b) is the federal transaction exemption not found in the USA, and only a trustee in bankruptcy is considered for the exemption. 30. B. Passing the exam allows you make no claims other than that it was a requirement for licensure. And you're not registered with the SEC, only with the state(s). 31. B. While UGMA only permits gifts of cash and securities, other property, such as real estate and limited partnership interests, may be held in UTMA accounts. Taxation is the same, as is the fiduciary liability of the custodian. In most cases, the beneficiary has access to a UTMA account at a later age than was the case with UGMA. 32. D. Making regular periodic investments of a fixed amount is the principle of dollar cost averaging. There is no such concept as overfunding an IRA; excess contributions are penalized. 33. B. The advance/decline theory compares the number of stocks advancing versus those declining, generally on the New York Stock Exchange. Because it uses such a large sample, it is used as an example of the breadth of the market. 34. A. U.S. exports should increase when foreigners have greater purchasing power. That occurs when their currency is stronger than the dollar. 35. B. U.S. Treasury bonds are quoted in 32nds, where the difference between 96.22 and 96.18 represents an increase of 4/32nds per bond. That is one-eighth, or $1.25, times 10 bonds, or $12.50 36. C. This question is about comparing support and resistance levels. Most stock prices remain relatively stable and fluctuate up and down within a narrow range. The lower limit to these fluctuations is called a support level - the price point where a stock appears cheap and attracts buyers. The upper limit is called a resistance level - the price point where a stock appears expensive and initiates selling. Generally, a support level will develop after a stock has experienced a steady decline from a higher price level. Technicians believe that, at some price below the recent peak, other investors will buy who did not buy prior to the first price increase and have been waiting for a small reversal to get into the stock. When the price reaches this support level, demand surges and price and volume begin to increase again. 37. D. On an exchange, the specialist (now called the DMM) performs both an agency and a dealer function. That action of buying and selling from inventory is performed by market makers in the OTC market. 38. C. Under the Uniform Securities Act, if an IA receives a check made payable to an unrelated third party, it will be considered custody unless forwarded within three business days of receipt. Third-party checks are never considered custody under federal law. 39. C. Since fixed annuities are not securities, a presentation dealing solely with that topic is not covered under the anti-fraud statutes of the USA. 40. D. A portfolio of listed common stocks will have little to no liquidity risk, as listed shares are easily traded. Even though common stock tends to offer protection against inflation, there is no assurance that the portfolio will keep pace with the rising cost of living. 41. D. All relationships between registered investment advisers and a promoter where compensation is involved must be in writing. It is important to note that compensation is defined as more than $1,000 over a 12 -month period. Making sure that the content of any scripts is fair and balanced is the responsibility of the investment adviser, regardless of who prepared them. Those subject to statutory disqualification (\"bad actors\") may not be used as solicitors if compensation is to be received. Cash referral fees to promoters are not restricted to impersonal advisory services. 42. C. When it comes to investment advisers, state-registered or federal covered, any advertisement which does not comply with the SEC's Investment Adviser Marketing Rule as found in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (federal law) would be prohibited. On the other hand, broker-dealers must comply with FINRA's rule on communication with the public as well as the NASAA Statement of Policy on Dishonest or Unethical Business Practices of Broker-Dealers and Agents. 43. D. For those with large taxable estates, the purchase of life insurance to cover the potential estate tax liability is frequently recommended. The use of the ILIT will generally keep the proceeds out of the estate. The alternative valuation date only helps if the value of the estate drops sometime during the six months after death. A testamentary trust does little, if anything, to reduce estate taxes, and the capital needs analysis is used to determine the replacement value needed in the event of premature death—unlikely to have a need with this large of an estate. 44. D. Form 13F must be filed by institutional money managers with at least $100 million in 13(f) equity securities under discretionary management. 45. B. Securities with a negative correlation add diversification to a growth portfolio because they move in the opposite direction of the balance of the holdings. Therefore, losses are offset by gains. 46. A. There are two widely accepted forms of common stock price valuations using dividends—the dividend discount model and the dividend growth model. 47. D. The only exemptions from the IA brochure rule are registered investment companies (both open and closed-end) and impersonal advice costing less than $500 per year. 48. A. Sometimes referred to as a medical directive or advanced care directive, a living will is used to express the author's end-of-life wishes, such as organ donation plans, desired medical treatment, and so forth. 49. D. The bond with the longest duration is generally going to have the greatest exposure to interest rate risk. Because there is very little difference between maturity dates of 2050 through 2052, the bond with the lowest coupon will have the longest duration. The 4s of 2022 have a relatively short duration, even though their coupon is low. 50. D. Only those risks that are unsystematic can benefit from diversification. 51. A. With a TIPS bond, the principal is adjusted every six months by the inflation rate. When that rate is 6%, there is a 3% semiannual adjustment. Multiplying the $1,000 par value times 103% six times (there are six semiannual adjustments in three years) results in a principal value just over $1,194. Because the 4% coupon rate is paid semiannually, the payment at the end of three years will be the adjusted principal of $1,194 times 2%, and that equals $23.88. For testing purposes, you can always arrive at the correct answer by using simple instead of compounded interest. That is, with a 6% annual inflation rate, the bond's principal will increase by $60 per year for three years. That would make the adjusted principal $1,180. Take 2% of that and the result is $23.60. The correct answer will always be the next greater number. 52. B. Present value is calculated to determine the amount required now to have a specified value at some time in the future. It is what we are looking for so we don't have it now. 53. C. Alpha is the extent to which a portfolio outperforms its expected returns. Expected returns are based on the systematic risk of the portfolio (its beta). In order to exceed those returns, one must generally construct a portfolio that deviates from the market allocations. With tactical asset allocation, the manager either overweights or underweights the portfolio allocations based on near-term expectations of returns on those assets classes. The other choices are all basically the same, with little or no attempt to time the market's ups and downs. 54. D. One of the important requirements when hiring a promoter to solicit advisory business for compensation is making sure the person is not statutorily disqualified from registration. That is, any person who would be unable to register as a securities professional because of prior conduct cannot act as a solicitor for a registered investment adviser. The industry refers to this person as a \"bad actor.\" Compensation, defined as more than a de miminis amount (more than $1,000 over the previous 12 months), requires a written (not oral) agreement. One of the changes made by the SEC's Investment Adviser Marketing Rule in 2020 was the elimination of the requirement to deliver a solicitor's brochure. 55. C. The breakpoints allow for combinations from a number of family accounts, but they have to be spouse or dependent children, not brothers 56. B. Cash flow from operations is the sum of net income plus non-expended business expenses such as depreciation. 57. D. Flexible premium means that the policyholder can elect to skip premium payments. This is a feature of all universal life policies, but only in the case of the universal variable life does the performance of the separate account impact benefits. 58. B. The four phases of the business cycle are expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. While inflation typically increases during expansion and reduces during contraction, it, in itself, is not a term used to describe one of the phases. 59. D. Although NASAA would like to see registered IAs be financially successful, the BCP is not designed to assure profits. 60. B. In the event of a civil judgment, the purchaser is able to claim for a return of the original investment, not current market, plus interest at the state's legal rate. This interest is reduced, however, by any income received on that security. In addition, the broker-dealer or agent is liable for courts costs and attorney's fees. 61. D. Regulation S-P uses two terms: customer and consumer. The customer is one with an ongoing relationship, such as would be the case with an advisory contract. A consumer is basically a one-shot deal. 62. C. A positive yield curve is the normal condition and occurs when long-term rates are higher than short-term rates. Buying short-term bonds tends to drive their prices up and their yields down, while selling long-term bonds has the opposite effect. 63. D. Not included in the fee disclosure documents are commissions, markups and markdowns, and advisory fees. 64. C. If two portfolios have a high correlation coefficient, it means that their performance will be very similar. The purpose of diversification is to have some negative correlation so that losses in one portfolio are offset by gains in the other. U10LO6 65. A. A standard deviation of 14% means an investor can expect a return on an investment to vary ±14 from the average return approximately 68% of the time. A return of +26% minus the 12% average return equals 14%. Likewise, the difference between the -2% return and the average of 12% is also 14%. 66. D. Any debt security, even a subordinated debenture, has a claim ahead of all equity. However, they are subordinated to all other debt. 67. C. A market maker's quote always reflects the price he is willing to pay (the bid) and the price at which he is willing to sell (offer). The difference between these two is the spread 68. A. Knowing the names of firms where the client has had previous accounts doesn't tell us anything about his risk tolerance. 69. C. An investment adviser must provide full disclosure to his client if there would be even a hint of conflict of interest. This will include the case where a recommended product will generate a commission or other source of income to the adviser, as well as full disclosure if a recommendation is not consistent with the adviser's own activity in his own account. The adviser can use any source of information to create his own analysis, with disclosure of source only being required if the adviser uses the product of a third party as the presentation to the client. It would be unusual that all clients with the same or similar objectives would purchase or have recommended for purchase the same securities. 70. C. When an option is exercised, the seller (writer) of the option is the one who must deliver (call) or purchase (put). In all of the other choices, the issuer is the one who delivers the stock. 71. C. The safe harbor requirements of ERISA Section 404(c) relieve the trustee of a 401(k) plan of liability if the plan participants have the ability to select from at least three different investments and are allowed to make selection changes no less frequently than quarterly. Immediate vesting is required in a safe harbor 401(k), which is one that is safe from top-heavy testing. 72. A. In most cases, stock subject to Rule 144 is stock that cannot be immediately resold. That is why it is known as restricted stock. U12LO4 73. C. If the annuity contract calls for an 80% participation rate with no cap, then the investor will receive 80% of the performance of the index. In this case, 80% of a 15% return is 12%. 74. A. Normally, registration of persons becomes effective at noon of the 30th day following filing. If the Administrator requires the filing of amendments, the clock starts over again with the filing of those amendments, not the original filing date. Agents do not have financial requirements, and the Administrator has a maximum of one year after termination to initiate any actions. U3LO5 75. C. It is only the ISO where the employee can possibly receive capital gain treatment U12LO3 76. B. All of these would be included in the USA's definition of person. Not included are a minor, a deceased person, or someone judged mentally incompetent. 77. C. The quick asset ratio is CA minus inventory divided by the CL. In this question, it is $15 million - $6 million = $9 million / $6 million = 1.5:1. 78. C. The formula for current yield is annual current dividend divided by current market value. The trick with this question is that you are given a semiannual dividend as information. You must multiply the dividend by 2 to find the annual dividend. Therefore, $ .75 × 2 = $1.50 annual dividend. $1.50 / $60 = 2.50% 79. D. The nature of futures, being standardized with a fluid secondary market, makes them more suitable for speculators than forwards. In fact, it is futures that are almost always closed out prior to expiration. U16LO4 80. C. The par value of the common stock is irrelevant to this question. In order for a stock selling at $40 to have a current yield of 4%, the annual dividend must be $1.60. Because common stock dividends are typically paid quarterly, more than likely, the quarterly dividend is $.40 per share. U23LO1 81. A. The registration of an agent is not effective during any period when he is not associated with a particular broker-dealer registered under the Uniform Securities Act or a particular issuer. U3LO3 82. A. The executor of an estate has the option of valuing the assets either as of the date of death or six months later (the alternative valuation date). If stock prices fall, then the estate will shrink, resulting in lower estate taxes. U21LO5 83. A. When an investor sells an option, put, or call, the premium is received, generating immediate income. LEAPS are long-term options and, like all long options positions, do not generate any income. A periodic payment variable annuity will not begin any payout until the end of the deferral period. U16LO2 84. C. Tenancy by the entirety is most commonly used for ownership of real property (real estate). U18LO2 85. D. Even though everything relating to ADRs is done in English using U.S. dollars on domestic stock markets, there is still currency risk since the ultimate value of the stock and its dividends are based upon the foreign company's home currency. U12LO5 86. C. An advertisement describing a charting system or any type of formula must always state that there are limitations and difficulties to using said system. U6LO5 87. C. This investor is looking to hedge his risk of loss. The best way to hedge a long position is to buy a put option. U20LO12 88. C. On the first day, the value increased by twice the 10% the ETF gained (20% × 100 = 20). That makes the share value $120. On the second day, the value decreased by twice the 10% the ETF lost, (20% × 120 = 24). That makes the current value $96. U17LO3 89. D. DDA stands for demand deposit account, most commonly, a bank checking account. It, like all other bank accounts, carries FDIC insurance. GICs offer neither. Money market funds offer check-writing, but no FDIC coverage; negotiable CDs offer FDIC coverage, but no check-writing. U13LO14 90. A. If you are working for a registered investment adviser within a specific state, that state securities administrator wants to know who you are. The problem becomes a question of who is responsible for notifying the State Securities Administrator of your employment. A federal registered investment adviser is exempt from registration at the state level, and therefore, has very little contact with the state. If you go to work for a federal registered investment adviser, it becomes your duty to notify the State Securities Administrator that you are working there, as well as when you terminate. U2LO3 91. A. The balance sheet reflects the difference between the company's assets and liabilities. This is the owner's or shareholder's equity. Profits and dividends are on the income statement. U9LO1 92. B. All investment adviser representatives are registered with the states, not the SEC. Renewal requires the payment of the annual renewal registration or licensing fee. The consent to service of process is a permanent document submitted with the initial application for registration. U2LO3 93. B. Because Irving works for a registered investment adviser and provides advice on securities (where they are traded is irrelevant), he must register as an IAR, regardless of the nature of the securities that are the subject of his advice. There is no such thing as a federal covered IAR, only a federal covered IA. If the advice relates to securities, no one is exempt from the anti-fraud rules. U2LO1 94. D. Cash dividends are paid out of the company's net income, so an increase or decrease will not impact that net income. Net income is a calculation determined by current operations, so an increase in the amount set aside as an allowance for bad debts will reduce operating income. Because net income is always after taxes, raising the company's income tax rate will obviously decrease the net income of the corporation. One of the major expenses for most corporations is labor so any increase, whether in the form of raises or bonuses, will decrease the net income. U9LO1 95. C. Any negotiable instrument that has a yield component will be subject to interest rate risk. The insured bank CD cannot be traded and, therefore, will not be affected by changes in market interest rates. TIPS protect against inflation, and zero-coupon bonds have the greatest interest rate risk. U11LO1 96. D. A 6% cumulative preferred stock with a $25 par value would pay an annual dividend of $1.50 ($25 × 6%). Cumulative preferred requires all dividends that have previously been skipped be paid before any dividends paid to common stock. The $.50 that was paid last year left $1 in dividends in arrears. Therefore, this year requires that a $2.50 dividend be paid to the preferred shareholders before any common dividend paid to common shareholders. 97. A. Adoption is the use of content or a link that is solely the creation of someone else; your firm is just using it. Entanglement is when the firm had a role in the creation of the material. U6LO5 98. D. An investor's total return percentage is calculated by adding together income plus capital gain (or loss) and dividing that total by the initial cost. The math looks like this: three quarterly dividends of $1 each is $300. Selling the stock at $59 per share represents a loss of $1 per share or $100. The net positive return is $200 which, when divided by the original cost of $60 per share, results in a total return of 3.33% Even though the CPI is given, the question is not asking for inflation adjusted or real rate of return; it is just another example of a question containing unnecessary information. U23LO2 99. B. The yield to maturity of a bond considers the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium as well as the annual coupon rate, taking into consideration the time value of money. U23LO1 100. D. The requirement for written advisory contracts is found in both the Investment Company Act of 1940 for those advising registered investment companies and the Uniform Securities Act for state-registered advisers. Oddly, there is no mention made of this requirement in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Sure, it makes good sense, but it is not required. There is nothing in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that relates to investment advisers, much less their contracts with clients. U6LO4 101. D. Supply and demand in the marketplace sets the premium of a listed option. All of the other choices are standardized. U16LO1 102. B. The speaking income earned by the school teacher is considered self-employment income and is therefore eligible for a Keogh Plan. Remember, corporate employees are not eligible unless they have separate source of self-employment income. U24LO2 103. A. Sell stop orders are frequently referred to as stop loss orders and are used either when a security is purchased to offer downside protection or, as in this case, to preserve a gain that has not yet been realized. Buy stops are used to protect against loss or preserve the gain on a short position. U22LO6 104. D. Selling short is a technique used by investors who are of the opinion that the market price of a stock is going to fall. U22LO1 105. D. Because general obligation bonds are backed by taxes rather than revenues, they are generally more secure. Coupon yields on highest-rated municipal bonds are generally lower than those available on corporate bonds with similar maturities. However, the federal tax-free status makes those yields competitive, but only to those in the higher tax brackets. In most cases, only municipal bonds offered by issuers in a specific state are exempt from that state's income tax. U13LO5 106. A. Issuing stock brings in new capital in the form of cash. This raises the assets and, since stock is equity, raises the net worth by the same amount. U9LO1 107. A. An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is designed to describe the plan's investment goals and investment strategies. It typically identifies levels of risk acceptable in the construction of a portfolio. An IPS establishes the strategic framework utilized by the fiduciary to manage a portfolio. U24LO5 108. B. REITs are pooled tangible real estate assets. Owning an equity REIT gives the investor beneficial ownership of tangible real estate with the possibility of both income and capital appreciation. Most REITs trade in the open market, and their price is determined by supply and demand; there is no redemption by the issuer. REITs will pay distributions in the form of dividends and not a pass-through of principal and interest, as is the case with a mortgage-backed security, such as those issued by GNMA. Although REITs pass through at least 90% of their taxable income, there is no flow-through of losses as is the case with direct participation programs (DPPs). 109. D. Contracts between funds and their advisers may not be terminated with more than 60 days' written notice, and these contracts must—not should—be in writing. The initial contract is for a two-year period and then renewed on an annual basis. Whether or not the fund can trade on margin is not a function of the management contract. U14LO1 110. A. Income funds invest in those companies who tend to be more liberal in their dividend payout, thus enabling the fund to provide income to the investor. Be careful. The question did not ask about a fund that paid regular dividends; it was the portfolio securities that were the dividend payers, and that could not be a bond fund. U19LO6 111. B. Doing the arithmetic, we see that the market capitalization of KAPCO common stock is $3.3 billion. Stocks with a market cap in the range of $2 - $10 billion are considered mid-cap. U20LO6 112. C. A broker-dealer must be registered in every state it sells or offers to sell securities, unless an exemption is available. If a broker-dealer has no office in a particular state and no business is done in that state other than with institutional clients, registration there is not required. U3LO2 113. B. Proper investment planning involves saving for retirement and what steps are taken to reach that goal are influenced by the time remaining. Future plans are developed using current assets as the starting point. We don't care where the assets are, just what they are. U19LO2 114. C. Closed-end investment company shares trade like any other stock on the exchanges or Nasdaq. That is, the price is determined by supply and demand, not NAV. U14LO2 115. D. Contributions to an ESA are limited to $2,000 per beneficiary per year, while the 529 limit is set by the plan sponsor, sometimes as high as $500,000. Unlike the ESA where there is a ceiling on the earnings for a contributor, there is no limit for someone setting up a 529. Both Section 529 plans and Coverdell ESAs enjoy tax-free distributions, and plans may be established by almost anyone. U24LO6 116. C. Class A shares have a front-end load, but their operating expense ratio is usually lower than that of any other class. Because the question states that the investor is willing to pay a sales charge, no-load shares is an inappropriate choice. U14LO3 117. A. Once the entertainment agent makes investment decisions for a client who is paying fees for overall services rendered, that agent now comes under the IA-1092 definition of investment adviser. In a like manner, any person who is compensated for giving investment-related advice to employee benefit plans is considered a pension consultant, requiring registration under IA-1092. Banks are never IAs, and the lawyer is merely doing legal and tax work. U1LO2 118. D. Securities acquired as a gift carry the donor's cost basis and date of purchase. In this case, the cost is $25 and the holding period began in 2020. So, the sale is long term and the profit is $7 per share. U21LO5 119. C. When the exam asks about precious metals, there are only four that exist. Those are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. U17LO6 120. A. In order to maintain SEC registration, an investment adviser must maintain assets under management of no less than $90 million. The annual updating amendment is used to disclose this information. U1LO5 121. B. When an investor is not sure which direction the market will move but has a strong opinion that there will be dynamic movement, a strategy that might be employed is the purchase of a straddle. This is the combining of a put and a call on the same stock with the same exercise price and expiration date. U16LO2 122. D. When a business is set up as a sole proprietorship, the owner carries unlimited personal liability for all of the company's debts. In each of the other choices, the liability is basically limited to the amount invested. U18LO3 123. D. The Roth IRA is the only one of these where there are no required minimum distributions once reaching age 72 . If still employed by the sponsor of a qualified plan, RMDs are not required from that plan, but the question would have to state that. U24LO4 124. C. Orders from anyone other than the account owner need written trading authorization prior to acceptance. U7LO2 125. B. The support level of a stock is the historic repeating bottom. That is, whenever the stock gets that low, it brings out the buyers and pushes the price up. However, when a stock breaks through the support level, it is usually an indication that the support has dried up and there is going to be further decline. That is good for the short-seller. U12LO6 126. A. Over long periods of time, a diversified portfolio of common stock has been proven to be an effective hedge against inflation. However, ownership of stock does entail business and market risk; systematic and market risk are synonymous. U11LO1 127. B. There are two principals in every securities trade: the buyer and the seller. In this case, selling shares directly to the client from its own account places the IA in the position of being one of the principals. This is an action that must be disclosed in writing to the client no later than completion of the transaction. In agency cross transaction, the firm is acting as an agent rather than a principal; that's the reason for the term. U7LO1 128. D. Clients have the right to buy or sell whatever they desire. The issue becomes a question of who initiates the trade. An unsolicited transaction may be executed by an agent if it is the client who asks for the trade. The trade ticket should be marked as unsolicited. The State Securities Administrator has the right to seek verification from the client that the trade was, in fact, unsolicited. The security involved in the trade can be one that is nonexempt and unregistered in the state. U4LO3 129. C. Transfer on death, or TOD as it is usually called, would be the appropriate choice here. It avoids probate, but not estate taxes. It allows the account owner to specify different percentages for each beneficiary if desired. U18LO5 130. B. Tangible assets, such as real estate, precious metals, and other commodities, tend to keep pace with inflation. Fixed-dollar investments do not. U20LO1 131. B. In the Uniform Securities Act, guaranteed means guaranteed as to payment of principal, interest, or dividends by some third party other than the issuer. U6LO3 132. C. Changing the discount rate is a function of the Federal Reserve Board in implementing monetary policy. U8LO1 133. C. Even though hedge funds are known for using speculative strategies such as selling short and margin trading, the reasoning behind that is to enable the fund to perform well in both bull and bear markets. Although they do appeal to the sophisticated investor, that is a by-product, not a goal. Yes, the management fees are higher than with other investments, but that is the goal of the adviser, not the fund. U14LO4 134. A. When preservation of capital is a goal and one of the choices is an insured bank CD, pick it. When the question refers to a low tax bracket, municipal bonds will never be the correct choice. Newly issued Treasury bonds have maturities of at least 10 years. During that time, changes to interest rates in the market place would cause the market price of those bonds to fluctuate. Although the public utilities will offer income frequently higher than the CD, there are no guarantees the principal will remain intact. (Some public utilities have gone bankrupt.) U19LO5 135. D. When an individual receives compensation for selling employer stock to employees, that person is defined as an agent and must register as such. Managing a pension plan (and getting paid for it, naturally) does not make one an agent; she is not being compensated for the trades. Because banks and trust companies are excluded from the definition of a broker-dealer, their employees cannot be considered agents. U3LO4 136. D. A corporation's capital structure consists of its long-term debt plus shareholders' equity. U9LO1 137. D. Tactical asset allocation, also known as active asset allocation, attempts to time the market. As such, there is a relatively high amount of in and out trading, causing commission expense to be a significant factor. U20LO3 138. D. Unlike a qualified plan, a nonqualified plan is permitted to discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Because there are so few regulations involved, the administrative costs of a nonqualified plan are much lower than those for a qualified plan. The nonqualified plan, typically deferred compensation, allows for a tax deduction when the money is ultimately paid out to the employee or beneficiary. U24LO3 139. D. The arithmetic mean is the same as the average. In this case, add together the three returns and then divide by three. 4 + 5 + 9 = 18 / 3 = 6% U10LO2 140. B. There are only two exemptions from NASAA's (and the SEC's) brochure delivery rule. They are when the client is a registered investment company and when the adviser's clients receive only impersonal advice and pay less than $500 in fees per year. Qualified clients, those with at least $1.1 million in assets with the investment adviser or net worth of at least $2.2 million, may be charged performance fees, but that has nothing to do with brochure delivery.
