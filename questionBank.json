If a teacher (or any of the others) is compensated specifically for giving advice, even if it's a small amount, the exclusion is no longer valid. To be classified as an investment adviser, one must provide advice on securities; term life insurance does not qualify as a security. Additionally, preparing trust documents does not constitute securities advice, even if clients are referred by an investment adviser.

Fixed payments from annuity contracts are also not classified as securities. Commodity futures contracts and the commodities themselves do not fall under the definition of securities."

The best way to hedge (protect) a short stock position is to purchase a call option on the security because that gives you a guaranteed \"buy-back\" price regardless of how high the stock's price rises. If you sell a put on the stock and the price rises, the put will expire and the seller will have the premium to partially offset any loss. If the short seller enters a buy stop order, once the price rises (or goes through) the stop price, a market order to buy the stock will be entered and the position will be closed out preventing any further loss."

To hedge his bond holdings with futures, the futures position must move in the opposite direction:  lose when Treasury prices increase, and gain when Treasury prices decrease.  A short position on the Treasury futures will exhibit this gain/loss profile.  Since the contract size is given as $100,000, and Kevin wants to fully hedge his $500,000 of bond holdings, he needs to go short enough contracts to get $500,000 of futures exposure:  $500,000 exposure desired/$100,000 per contract = 5 contracts.  Kevin needs to short 5 contracts to fully hedge."

That means giving continuous investment advice to clients based on their individual needs. That is frequently accomplished by selecting model portfolios most appropriate to the client's needs. The financial planner clearly is not principally in the business of offering investment advice because he describes his service as offering a wide range of services, of which advice is only a part. The exam frequently uses that wording to indicate that advice is not the principal activity.

These advisers are called federal covered advisers. Investment managers who manage less than $100 million must register with the state Administrator. Advisers with at least $100 million but less than $110 million of assets under management have the option to register with either their state Administrator or with the SEC. Once the $110 million level is reached, registration with the SEC is mandatory. With $135 million under management, Foster Advisers must register with the SEC. Foster Advisers is subject to the additional requirement of notifying the administrators of the securities departments of states in which it maintains offices or clients of its operations. At the state level, a notification fee (but not registration) is generally required. One aim of the NSMIA was to eliminate dual registration of investment advisers with the states and the SEC.

        "explanation": "A bond's duration measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. The longer the duration, the greater the sensitivity (bigger the price swings). As a bond approaches its maturity date, its duration gets shorter and shorter. The rate of income on a bond is set at issuance. The nominal (coupon) yield never changes - that is why bonds are known as fixed-income investments. Duration has nothing to do with a bond's rating and, as is the case with the coupon, a bond's maturity date is set when the bond is issued."

One of those is the amount of credit risk (chances that the issuer won't be able to pay the interest and/or principal). That is not considered a risk with U.S. Treasury securities. The other, and generally stronger influence, is the inflation rate. Inflation eats away at the fixed income and principal of bonds. To compensate, the bonds must offer a higher return. That is either in the form of a new bond carrying a higher coupon rate, or, as this question refers to, trading in the secondary market at a lower price. Remember the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. Interest rates follow the inflation rate, so when inflation rises, so must the yield on bonds.

The other choices given in the question are known as settlor functions. The most common settlor functions are design decisions involving: establishment of the plan, defining who are the covered employees and benefits to be provided, and amending or terminating the plan. Because the likelihood of an IAR ever performing settlor functions is quite remote (usually they are done by employees of the sponsoring employer), I cannot fathom why NASAA would ask something like this on the exam.

        "explanation": "The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows the SEC to require corporations to file financial information on a regular basis.  The SEC currently requires an annual report, known as a 10-K, to be filed within 60 to 90 days of the end of each company's fiscal year.  The SEC also requires quarterly reports, known as 10-Q's, to be filed within 40 to 45 days of the end of each fiscal quarter (three-month period).  Since XYZ has a December 31 fiscal year-end, it must file a 10-K within 60 to 90 days of December 31.  Statement II is therefore true.  XYZ is also required to file 10-Q's within 40 to 45 days of its quarter-end dates of March 31, June 30, and September 30.  Statement I is therefore also true. The SEC does not have a requirement known as the \"3-Q\", so Statement III is not true (as noted above, a 10-Q is due for within 40 to 45 days of September 30). The 8-K is for reporting special events, rather than being part of a company's annual and quarterly reporting, so Statement IV is not true."

The lower limit to these fluctuations is called a support level, the price range where a stock appears cheap and attracts buyers. The upper limit is called a resistance level.<br /><br />Generally, a support level will develop after a stock has experienced a steady decline from a higher price level. Technicians believe that at some price during the decline, those investors who have been waiting for a reversal to get into the stock will now buy. When the price reaches this support price, demand surges, and price and volume begin to increase again.<br /><br />Other terms that may be used in this context are overbought and oversold. Overbought generally refers to the resistance level. Interest in buying the stock has begun to dry up and the price of the stock plateaus. Oversold is when the opposite occurs: there are few sellers to be found and the price of the stock bottoms. In either case, the next move is a reversal: down when the stock is overbought and up when oversold.<br /><br />U12LO6</span>"

The lower limit to these fluctuations is called a support level - the price point where a stock appears cheap and attracts buyers. The upper limit is called a resistance level - the price point where a stock appears expensive and initiates selling. Generally, a support level will develop after a stock has experienced a steady decline from a higher price level. Technicians believe that, at some price below the recent peak, other investors will buy who did not buy prior to the first price increase and have been waiting for a small reversal to get into the stock. When the price reaches this support level, demand surges and price and volume begin to increase again."

Then .8 * [18% - 4%] or .8 * 14%, which equals 11.2%. The final step is 12 - 11.2, giving us a positive alpha of .8. Using these numbers, some find it easier to compare 80% of the market return (after removing the risk-free rate) to the actual return, once again, after the RF rate.

So Trapezoid may charge a fee based on performance vs. the S&P 500 to Cory (Item II), since Cory has over $1,000,000 to invest, and to the mutual fund (Item III).  Maria (Item I), with only $100,000 to invest, does not meet the criteria for a sophisticated investor, so Trapezoid cannot structure her fees to be based on performance vs. the S&P 500."

You can always work backward to check by deducting the 25% tax from each answer to see which one results in the 3% coupon. The fact that the bond is unrated has little or nothing to do with the ability of the issuer to pay the interest."

The GTC stop order placed above the market (buy stop order) will be triggered if the stock rises high enough to touch the stop price. But there is no guaranteed execution price with a stop order, therefore the client's attempt to limit loss might be compromised with a stop order. However, buying a call option guarantees the client the right to buy 100 shares of the subject stock at a guaranteed exercise or strike price, making it the most effective of the hedges. Buying a put option would be a wonderful hedge for a long stock position, not short stock."

        "explanation": "Dollar cost averaging involves investing a set amount of money each interval. If the market fluctuates, this will cause the client to buy more shares when the prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. The result of this is a lower average cost per share than average price paid. An investor who sells shares when the market rises and buys shares when the market declines is not dollar cost averaging, but is attempting to time the market. An investor who averages the cost of the shares purchased and then enters limit orders to purchase additional shares at the average price is not engaged in a dollar cost averaging program. In dollar cost averaging, the same dollar amount is invested each interval."

        "explanation": "Foreign interest rate differentials are not reflected in an upward sloping yield curve. Interest rate differentials between countries reflect differences in domestic monetary and fiscal conditions. The time value of money is reflected in the upward sloping yield curve. Longer-term rates require higher rates to compensate for loss of current buying power and liquidity. Longer-term funds bear a higher risk of default than do shorter-term funds and, as a result, command higher rates. Increasing inflation expectations cause the yield curve to slope upward to compensate lenders for the loss of future buying power."

        "explanation": "Only the State H bond is exempt from federal income tax. Using the tax equivalent yield formula of the muni coupon divided by (100% minus the investor's tax bracket %) we get 5% divided by 65% or 7.7%. That's a better deal than receiving 6% on the Treasury and paying taxes as well as 7% on the Canadian bond (although you learned that securities issued by Canadian provinces were exempt from registration under the Uniform Securities Act, that has nothing to do with U.S. income taxes). However, with a TEY of 7.7%, your client would take home more with the 8% taxable corporate security. You can also work backward to get the correct answer. Simply subtract 35% tax from each of the choices (other than the muni) and see which is the highest. In this case, 8% minus a 35% tax equals 5.2%-just a bit higher than the 5% coupon on the municipal bond."

No such benefit accrues to money market funds (their dividends are generated from interest income) and government bond interest is always taxed as ordinary income (although state income tax free). The dividends on a growth stock would also qualify, but, since the question deals with increasing current income, public utility is a more sensible approach.

Had this been a state registered IA, the answer would have been the same, even though the dollar limit is $500 rather than $1,200.

Furthermore, an offer to buy or to sell is accepted in a state when acceptance is communicated to the offeror orally or in writing, inside, or outside the state. The offer originated in New York and was directed to Georgia where it was accepted. The mailing of the confirmation is of no consequence.

        "explanation": "With a TIPS bond, the principal is adjusted every six months by the inflation rate. When that rate is 6%, there is a 3% semiannual adjustment. Multiplying the $1,000 par value times 103% six times (there are six semiannual adjustments in three years) results in a principal value just over $1,194. Because the 4% coupon rate is paid semiannually, the payment at the end of three years will be the adjusted principal of $1,194 times 2%, and that equals $23.88. For testing purposes, you can always arrive at the correct answer by using simple instead of compounded interest. That is, with a 6% annual inflation rate, the bond's principal will increase by $60 per year for three years. That would make the adjusted principal $1,180. Take 2% of that and the result is $23.60. The correct answer will always be the next greater number."

Cash value can be borrowed or withdrawn. Any borrowed amount that goes unreturned or any amount that is withdrawn permanently typically reduces the death benefit.</p><p>Term life insurance does not provide coverage for life, while neither universal or whole life insurance have a separate account (making both subject to increased inflation risk).
